You’ve probably heard that before – viewers might forgive sub-par video quality if they’re interested in what you’re saying, but if it’s hard to understand what you’re saying they’ll click away.</p><p>Getting an external mic (even a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-Seacue-Omnidirectional-Condenser-Smartphones/dp/B0727Z8TMX/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?ie=UTF8&qid=1504204000&sr=8-5&keywords=lav+mic" >$10 one-off Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>) is one of the best ways to improve your videos. That said, maybe your budget is $0. Or, maybe you just don’t happen to have a mic now and don’t want to wait to make videos. It could even be that you just don’t want to bother with an external mic.</p><p>Luckily, there are a lot of easy, free, things you can do to protect the quality of your audio recording even if you’re not using an external mic. Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li><a href="#close">1. Keep Your Camera Close</a></li><li><a href="#quiet">2. Shoot Somewhere Quiet</a></li><li><a href="#room">3. Pick a Good Room</a></li><li><a href="#wind">4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind</a></li><li><a href="#app">5. Use a Free Audio App</a></li><li><a href="#check">6. Do a Sound Check</a></li></ul><h2 id="1-Keep-Your-Camera-Close-like-really-close"><a href="#1-Keep-Your-Camera-Close-like-really-close" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep Your Camera Close (like, really close)"></a>1. Keep Your Camera Close (like, really close)</h2><p>The biggest problem with the mic built into any camera or phone is just that, since it’s with the camera, it’s usually too far away from you. Built-in mics can record decent audio up close, but usually, your camera will be set up farther away from you than an external mic would be.</p><p>For example, your camera’s mic might be just as good as a clip-on LAV, but that LAV is right by your mouth and the camera is a couple of big steps away.</p><p>Moving your camera&#x2F;smartphone physically closer to you will make it hard to include anything besides your head and shoulders in your shot, but it will get you significantly better audio.</p><h2 id="2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet"><a href="#2-Shoot-Somewhere-Quiet" class="headerlink" title="2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet"></a>2.Shoot Somewhere Quiet</h2><p>The best way to limit the amount of background noise you pick up in your sound recording is to shoot somewhere where there’s no background noise. That probably seems really basic, but it’s something a lot of people just don’t do. It’s easy to default to recording in your home office, even though it’s right next to the kitchen where your family is bustling around, or in your bedroom even though there’s a busy street right outside your window.</p><p>Sometimes the best thing you can do for your audio is simply to scout out a quiet room in your house where the sound recording conditions are better. Speaking of recording conditions…</p><h2 id="3-Pick-a-Good-Room"><a href="#3-Pick-a-Good-Room" class="headerlink" title="3. Pick a Good Room"></a>3. Pick a Good Room</h2><p>There’s more that goes into picking a good room than how quiet it is. If you try to record in a room that’s too big your voice might sound to distant, and if you try to record in a room that’s too small your audio will be too echo-y. You need a room that’s just right.</p><p>You should also pay attention to what’s in the room you’re recording in. Avoid hard, reflective, surfaces like appliances and mirrors which your voice will bounce off of. The same conditions that make you sound great when you sing in the shower will – like recording in a small space -make your voiceover unpleasantly echo-y.</p><p>Look for a room that has a lot of soft things in it, like beds and sofas.</p><h2 id="4-Protect-your-Built-In-Mic-from-Wind"><a href="#4-Protect-your-Built-In-Mic-from-Wind" class="headerlink" title="4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind"></a>4. Protect your Built-In Mic from Wind</h2><p>If you shoot outside, then the wind passing over your built-in mic will do terrible things to your audio. You can do a lot to counter-act this problem by physically blocking the wind.</p><p>There are a few ways to do this. If you’re doing hand-held shots you can partially cover your camera or phone’s mic with your finger. You don’t want to completely cover it&#x2F;press down or your audio will be muffled. What you’re trying to do is create a barrier blocking out the wind.</p><p>On movie sets, they block out wind by covering the microphones with big fuzzy things called ‘dead cats’. You can also block out wind noise by attaching something fuzzy to your microphone. If your camera’s built-in mic is on front of it then you just need something big and fluffy you can loop around the lens. You can use a piece of a boa, a fuzzy novelty scrunchie – you can even murder a fuzzy stuffed animal! Do you have an old coat with a fuzz around the hood? That fuzz would do nicely.</p><p><em>The pompom used in this video cost $2, but you might already have something that would work!</em></p><p>If your built-in mic is on top of your camera you can get something called a ‘micromuff’. A micromuff is essentially a circular or rectangular piece of velcro with long strands of fluff on top. It’s open in the middle so it doesn’t actually cover your mic, but the surrounding fuzz blocks out the wind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-better-audio-from-wind.jpg"                      alt="Record better audio from wind with micromuff"                ></p><p><em>You use the adhesive backing to attach the base velcro to your camera. The other side of the velcro has your fluff attached to the back.</em></p><p>The only thing about a micromuff is that it costs about $30, and if you’re going to spend $30 on audio equipment then you could just buy yourself an inexpensive LAV mic. I only bring up the micromuff because it’s a very simple design you can probably DIY – you just need velcro with adhesive backing and any of the fluff-sources we just discussed.</p><h2 id="5-Use-a-Free-Audio-App"><a href="#5-Use-a-Free-Audio-App" class="headerlink" title="5. Use a Free Audio App"></a>5. Use a Free Audio App</h2><p>If you’re recording on a smartphone, you can download a free app that will let you make adjustments to your audio as you record it. With the right app, you can adjust your gain (volume is how you control ‘output’ audio, and gain is for ‘input’ audio. By turning up your gain, you can make your mic more sensitive), tempo, and more. A lot of the time, your audio recording app will also let you edit your audio afterward.</p><p>Even if you’re not recording video from your smartphone, it might be a good idea to use your phone as your mic and record a separate audio file. You’ll be able to use an app to fine-tune your recording, and you can set your phone up closer to you the way you would an external mic while keeping your camera back a bit farther.</p><p>Free audio apps: Hi-Q MP3 Voice Recorder (Android), RecForge II (Android), Smart Voice Recorder (Android), Audio Memos (iOS), and Recorder Plus (iOS).</p><h2 id="6-Do-a-Sound-Check"><a href="#6-Do-a-Sound-Check" class="headerlink" title="6. Do a Sound Check"></a>6. Do a Sound Check</h2><p>Once you think you’ve got good audio set up – test it! You don’t want to do a whole video and find out when you play it back that your audio doesn’t sound good.</p><p>Do you have any of your own audio tips to pass on? Leave them in the comments!</p><p><em>This topic was suggested by RS Beauty over in the forums.

Against all odds, the average investor made a profit, and some of the most important stocks raised to new highs, and 2022 might bring even more profits for those who are patient and make their due diligence.</p><p>There is a lot of information online and in books about the stock market and how to make intelligent investments, but Youtube channels seem to be where most investors get their information from. This might be due to how easily information is passed to the listener.</p><p>In this article, we will talk about the best Youtube channels for the stock market. We will list the top fourteen channels that will definitely help you make the most out of your investment, whether you are looking for short or long-term investments.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">14 Best Stock Youtube Channels</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">FAQs about Stock Youtube Channels</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-14-Best-Stock-Youtube-Channels"><a href="#Part-1-14-Best-Stock-Youtube-Channels" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 14 Best Stock Youtube Channels"></a>Part 1: 14 Best Stock Youtube Channels</h2><h3 id="1-Sasha-Evdakov-Tradersfly"><a href="#1-Sasha-Evdakov-Tradersfly" class="headerlink" title="1.Sasha Evdakov: Tradersfly"></a>1.Sasha Evdakov: Tradersfly</h3><p>This is one of the best Youtube channels for stock market beginners. Sasha Evdakov is a great teacher and can introduce the hardest topics to everyone, regarding their level of knowledge in the stock market.</p><p>By going through his first videos, you’ll get a general idea of the basics of how to approach the stock market in 2022. He advocates more long-term investments and because he’s located in the United States, most of the information about stocks is about U.S. stocks. This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the largest companies in the world trade in the U.S. stock market. He’s very reciprocal and willing to share new ideas with his members. Definitely a good start if you want to dig more into stocks. He started his channel back in 2021 and releases videos once a week.</p><h3 id="2-Investors-Underground"><a href="#2-Investors-Underground" class="headerlink" title="2. Investors Underground"></a>2. Investors Underground</h3><p>Investors Underground is a 145K subscriber stock market channel based in the U.S. A great plus of this channel is its live chat and great instructional videos. It was created by two investors back in May of 2013. Besides having a strong following, in this channel, you can also connect with other traders and exchange information and tips on what stocks might be good to hold for the long term or others that might be better to sell.

It is not uncommon for older folk to enjoy this type of content, especially if they want to unwind after a long day. However, the industry is becoming pretty crowded, making it harder for content creators to stand out from the crowd.</p><p>An excellent way to get your target audience to notice you would be to design a killer YouTube banner that will immediately cause anyone scrolling past to click on your video. Stick around to learn how to create a great gaming YouTube banner with templates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gaming-youtube-banner-template.gif"                      alt="pholody interface"                ></p><h2 id="Importance-of-a-Banner-for-Your-YouTube-Gaming-Channel"><a href="#Importance-of-a-Banner-for-Your-YouTube-Gaming-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Importance of a Banner for Your YouTube Gaming Channel"></a>Importance of a Banner for Your YouTube Gaming Channel</h2><p>Imagine a scenario where you want to open a brick-and-mortar store. One of the most important things you need to get out of the way is the business name. Once you have settled on a fitting name, you will then move on to create a sign to place outside your shop.</p><p>For example, a banner for your YouTube gaming channel plays a similar role to signage for a brick-and-mortar shop.</p><ul><li>An excellent banner helps you make a solid first impression on your viewers, some of who is viewing your content for the first time.</li><li>Secondly, a well-designed banner reflects positively on your brand and helps you grow your audience at a steady rate.</li><li>Thirdly, you can use your banner to give your viewers a rough idea of what your video is about without them clicking to watch. A suitable banner can cause anticipation to build within your viewers. Once the video is over, they won’t resist visiting your channel to see what else you offer.</li></ul><h2 id="Guide-to-YouTube-Gaming-Banner-Size"><a href="#Guide-to-YouTube-Gaming-Banner-Size" class="headerlink" title="Guide to YouTube Gaming Banner Size"></a>Guide to YouTube Gaming Banner Size</h2><p>We can liken a banner for your YouTube video to a book cover to a novel you have been dying to read. Therefore, it would be wise to get the size right if you want to create an excellent first impression for yourself. Ideally, the best size for a YouTube banner is 2560*1440 pixels or an aspect ratio of 16:9.</p><p>We urge you not to upload a banner smaller than 2048*1152 pixels, or else the image will appear cropped. Keep your banner within 1235*338 pixels and centered on the screen to be on the safe side.</p><p>This YouTube banner dimension is ideal for viewing on any device since your audience might use their smartphones or laptop to watch your videos on YouTube. Lastly, ensure you keep the file to a maximum of 6MB. We believe this file size is pretty generous.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Designing-an-Attractive-Gaming-YouTube-Banner"><a href="#Tips-for-Designing-an-Attractive-Gaming-YouTube-Banner" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Designing an Attractive Gaming YouTube Banner"></a>Tips for Designing an Attractive Gaming YouTube Banner</h2><p>Below are some tips that will help you create beautiful YouTube banners.</p><p>Simplicity is key: Contrary to popular belief, a simple banner looks more polished than a complex one. If your YouTube banner has too many elements, your viewers using their mobile phones might have a challenge viewing the image.</p><p>Ensure the graphics are high-quality : Nothing is as frustrating to your viewers as seeing a blurry or pixelated YouTube banner. However, high-quality graphics with a resolution of at least 1920*1080 pixels make your work look polished and attract more viewers to your channel.</p><p>Leverage the grid system: Some of your viewers might watch your videos from their smartphones, and others on their laptops or tablets. The grid system allows you to ensure the full banner will be visible no matter what device your audience will use to watch your gaming videos.</p><p>Add a CTA: At the end of the day, you are trying to grow your audience on your YouTube channel. You might also have other social media platforms where you post content. Since your banner is one of the first things your audience will see, you could include a short, easy-to-read, and understandable call to action. For instance, you could encourage them to “Subscribe Now!”</p><p>Incorporate your unique color scheme: By now, you already have a theme for your YouTube channel that your existing subscribers associate with you. As you design your YouTube banner, ensure you incorporate your theme colors, so new visitors know what colors to look out for as they scroll on the platform.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-Templates-To-Create-Gaming-YouTube-Banners"><a href="#Why-Use-Templates-To-Create-Gaming-YouTube-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?"></a>Why Use Templates To Create Gaming YouTube Banners?</h2><p>First and foremost, a gaming youtube banner template takes the tedium out of creating a design from scratch.

But if you don’t keep on top of it, your Watch Later list can quickly become unmanageable and cluttered with content that you no longer want to watch afterward.</p><p>If you are wondering how, you can declutter the playlist, we’ve got you covered. To help you with the task, we’ve compiled a comprehensive step-by-step guide. In this article, we will show you how to clear Watch Later on YouTube with just a few clicks.</p><p>So, without beating around the bush, let’s get started with our tutorial!</p><h2 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist</h2><p>If your YouTube Watch Later playlist is filled with videos you’ll never watch again, or you are not interested in that specific content type, you can quickly delete these videos at any time.</p><p>Here’s the step-by-step process on <strong>how to clear Watch Later on YouTube Web and App:</strong></p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-Web" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On Web?</h3><p>You can delete the YouTube Watch Later Playlist on your desktop in the following ways:</p><h5 id="From-YouTube-Homepage"><a href="#From-YouTube-Homepage" class="headerlink" title="From YouTube Homepage"></a>From YouTube Homepage</h5><p>To clear the YouTube Watch Later Playlist from the YouTube Homepage, do the following steps:</p><p>Step1 First, open a browser on your PC and visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/index?feature=signin"><strong>YouTube homepage</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Sign into your account if needed and click the <strong>“Library”</strong> option located at the left-hand side menu panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-youtube-web-library.png"                      alt="accessing the youtube web library"                ></p><p>Step2 Croll down and click the <strong>“See All”</strong> option under the Watch Later header. Click the <strong>Three Dots</strong> below the Watch Later playlist details on the next page.</p><p>Step3 From the drop-down menu, click <strong>“Remove Watch Videos.”</strong> This will instantly remove all the videos you’ve watched but are still in the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/removing-watched-videos-from-youtube-watch-later.png"                      alt="removing watched videos from youtube watch later"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, to remove the unwatched videos, hover over a video and click the <strong>Three Dots</strong>. Select the <strong>“Remove from Watch Later”</strong> option to delete the video. You can repeat this process to remove all the content from the playlist until it is decluttered at the point of your satisfaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-the-youtube-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="clearing the youtube watch later playlist"                ></p><h5 id="Using-A-Script"><a href="#Using-A-Script" class="headerlink" title="Using A Script"></a>Using A Script</h5><p>Since the above process can be tiring, you can use a script to remove all the videos at once from the Watch Later playlist in the following way:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch the <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en%5Fpk/chrome/"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> browser on your system and head to the <strong>YouTube</strong> website**.** Next, select the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the left pane and click <strong>“Watch Later”</strong> from the menu.</p><p>Step2 Now, hit the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + J”</strong> keys on Windows or the <strong>“Command + Option+ J”</strong> buttons on Mac to launch the developer mode and open the console window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-script-to-clear-watch-later.png"                      alt="using script to clear watch later"                ></p><p>Step3 Copy and paste the following lines of the script at the end of the line under the Console tab where the cursor is blinking.</p><p>setInterval(function () { document.querySelector(‘#primary button[aria-label&#x3D;”Action menu”]‘).click(); var things &#x3D; document.evaluate(‘&#x2F;&#x2F;span[contains(text(),”Remove from”)]‘, document, null, XPathResult.ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE, null ); for (var i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; things.snapshotLength; i++) { things.snapshotItem(i).click(); } }, 1000);</p><p>Step4 In the last step, hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key to clear the Watch Later Playlist on YouTube. However, the process may take some time, depending on the number of videos in your playlist.</p><p>Although a bit tech-savvy, the script execution method is the most effective way to delete all Watch Later videos at once.</p><p>You can also replace the number at the end of the script with a lower entry to delete videos according to your preference. Also, choosing a lesser number can speed up the video deletion process from YouTube Watch Later list by a great deal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is important to note that experimenting with scripts is only for some. The script above has been confirmed to work, but others still need to be thoroughly checked and could potentially damage your computer. To prevent this from happening, only look for scripts from reliable sources instead of those posted by random people in various forums.</p><h3 id="How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App"><a href="#How-To-Delete-YouTube-Watch-Later-Playlist-On-YouTube-App" class="headerlink" title="How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?"></a>How To Delete YouTube Watch Later Playlist On YouTube App?</h3><p>If you are using YouTube on an Android or iOS device, it is possible to clear the Watch Later Playlist by doing the steps below:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, <strong>swipe up</strong> on the Homescreen of your Android device or <strong>swipe right</strong> on your iOS device to launch App Drawer, and tap “<strong>YouTube”</strong> to launch the app.</p><p>Step2 Now, tap the <strong>“Library”</strong> option in the bottom-right corner of the screen and tap <strong>“Watch Later.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-watch-later-playlist.png"                      alt="accessing the watch later playlist"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, tap the three dots (vertical ellipses) icon on the top-right side of the screen and choose the <strong>“Remove Watched Videos”</strong> option to delete them from the playlist.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/clearing-watch-later-on-youtube-app.png"                      alt="clearing watch later on youtube app"                ></p><p>Step4 If there are still unwatched videos in the playlist, select a video and tap the three dots next to it.

Interaction with your audience also builds a strong following. You can nurture a community by responding to comments, particularly if one of the viewers asks a direct question.

The look is highly inspirational in itself. The vintage effect in photography and videos results in a must-see look that everyone wants to capture all day long. The meaning of vintage is ‘the time when something of quality was produced.’ When something is called retro, it means old, recognized, and essential. Vintage also resembles love apart from videos and photos. All in all, it’s a positive and result-oriented thing to carry on in your videos. And this is what we want to mention in this post relating to the creation of vintage videos.</p><p>Here are some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >vintage-style video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for you to have a look at.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video"><a href="#What-to-Consider-When-Shooting-a-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?"></a>What to Consider When Shooting a Vintage Video?</h2><p>Vintage videos are kind of old school vibes and must be shooting accordingly by keeping in mind the following points. These are a sort of expert tips given by photographers based on their practical experience. First of all, you have to understand that a video can be made vintage, but you can’t change the actual environment of shooting. Some editing always involves there in every project out there. Still, the tips given below will help you a lot in creating a retro look.</p><h4 id="Use-Vintage-Lenses"><a href="#Use-Vintage-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Use Vintage Lenses"></a>Use Vintage Lenses</h4><p>The very first helpful tip is to use a vintage lens. They allow chromatic aberration by distorting colors around the frame. Furthermore, you can find various kinds of lenses in terms of a vintage effect.</p><h4 id="Decrease-Contrast"><a href="#Decrease-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="Decrease Contrast"></a>Decrease Contrast</h4><p>Do the correct color grading by reducing the contrast a little bit. You must not level the retro videos in black or white or like-new videos. You can simply add a contrasting effect and then reduce it to have that vintage look.</p><h4 id="Keep-it-a-little-soft"><a href="#Keep-it-a-little-soft" class="headerlink" title="Keep it a little soft"></a>Keep it a little soft</h4><p>If you have ever noticed, the vintage videos are a little soft and look like degraded with time. It’s a result of decreased sharpness in the camera’s menu settings. You can even add a slight blur to the final video or simply use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >recognized software made for video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Brighten-up-the-black-levels"><a href="#Brighten-up-the-black-levels" class="headerlink" title="Brighten up the black levels"></a>Brighten up the black levels</h4><p>Lots of black points in the video are not ideal for a vintage effect. The suitable approach is to bring up black levels and make it dark gray instead of inky black. This look can be achieved either by levels effect or curves effect in your editing software.</p><h4 id="Reduce-Saturation-levels"><a href="#Reduce-Saturation-levels" class="headerlink" title="Reduce Saturation levels"></a>Reduce Saturation levels</h4><p>Bringing down the saturation levels is another tip to create a vintage effect. The old videos are also absent in bright colors. Don’t go too crazy about reduction as 20%-30% saturation level is more than enough.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Stunning-Vintage-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?"></a>How to Create a Stunning Vintage Video?</h2><p>What you need to get started as both beginner and professional is Wondershare Filmora Video Editor. It is a highly recommended software to create vintage videos. The intuitive user interface and lots of editing functions are helpful for a video editor. It has both primary as well as advanced editing programs to check. It has various advanced color tuning tools to promote the making of original videos. It features tint, temperature, Vignette, 3D Luts, Lights, and so on.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Steps for the vintage effect to videos on Wondershare Filmora Video Editor</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Upload video &amp; make specific changes</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-1.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>The very step is to add the video by clicking the + icon. We have added the three <strong>sample videos</strong> from the library of Wondershare Filmora itself. Adjust them in the timeline as per your requirements.</p><p>After doing all the essential editing functions, click on the <strong>Effects tab</strong> given at the upper-left corner. Simply type the word Old in the Search tab.</p><p>The Old Video filter will immediately appear in the list of filters. Tap the <strong>“+”</strong> icon in Old Video filter to add to the timeline. Drag its ends right or left to adjust the duration.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Apply White &amp; Black Filters</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-2.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>The second step is to apply the Black &amp; White filters. Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and explore five Black &amp; White filters available. Each of these filters is quite different and must be applied accordingly. Check the aesthetic of your video clip before any filter application to retro videos.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the Sun Kissed or Sepia Tone Rise Filters to the video clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>There are various other categories of filters you can apply, such as Retro, Sun Kissed, and Sepia Tone, etc. The features of Filmora also present several subcategories such as Faux Film or Shake.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-4.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>On the other hand, the subcategory of Sepia Tone features Sun-Kissed &amp; Rise Filters to stimulate sepia-tinted texture and recreate the old visual style. The Sun Kissed filter presents brown and red colors to give that warm image atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Desaturate Video Clip</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-5.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Now, you need to desaturate the video clip with Ash &amp; Willow filters. We have typed Ash in the Search bar, and you can see the filter below. These filters are essential to desaturate the video with preset contrast, brightness, or exposure values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-6.png"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><p>Then, we have combined the black &amp; white filter with an overlay of Film Reel Horizontal. It will help you sell the effect and make the video look more authentic. However, the only application of Black &amp; White or Ash &amp; Willow filters is not going to make any creative thing in terms of vintage videos. You have to mix overlays with features such as Random Dust or Film Reel Horizontal.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Apply Black &amp; White and Old Film Color Correction Presets to the video</p><p>You can also access the Advanced color correction Tab of Filmora from the Color button. It also features Preset and Adjusts Tabs to desaturate footage. The Preset presents a variety of options, including Black &amp; White and Old Film. You just need to right-click the particular preset and select the Apply option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-advance-color-correction.jpg"                      alt="Vintage Videos"                ></p><h2 id="Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-Your-Vintage-Videos-Stand-Out" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out"></a>Tips to Make Your Vintage Videos Stand Out</h2><p>Following the helpful tips would assist you in creating awesome retro videos.</p><ul><li>You can use various vintage apps such as <strong>Retro VHS</strong>, <strong>RTRO Camera</strong>, <strong>8mm</strong>, <strong>Camcorder</strong>, <strong>VSCO</strong>, etc. Or, despite using these limited apps, you can directly use our preferred video editing software called <strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong>.</li><li>If you use a specific vintage camera, keep it on low highlights and low contrasts. Use color grading, as we have discussed above. They help to provide the ultimate old-school effect.</li><li>Always keep low saturation settings for shooting vintage videos. Take control over Saturation, Hue, and <strong>Luminance</strong> of video.</li><li>Add overlays and respective filters to recreate a required vintage look. You must add things that dust, scratch, and grain the heck out from the video that you have created.</li><li>Lower the frame rate or FPS to create an excellent vintage look. You can make it to 18 or 14 FPS depending upon the aesthetic requirements.</li><li>Keep an eye on black and white filters you have used. It’s because more of a black and white can ruin the actual vintage experience.</li></ul><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So, this is an ultimate tutorial on the creation of vintage videos.

This is due to a variety of circumstances. YouTube TV is simple to use. It has a channel lineup that is competitive with all of the others.</p><p>In addition, the YouTube TV price is reasonable. You can watch YouTube TV on almost any current gadget. And the fact that parent company Alphabet (aka Google) has been heavily marketing it over the last few years hasn’t hurt either.</p><p>A lot is going on with YouTube TV, and it’s only gotten better with time.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Watch YouTube TV?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Is Youtube Tv A Good Investment?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Frequently Asked Questions About Youtube TV</a></p><h2 id="What-Exactly-Does-Youtube-Tv-Entail"><a href="#What-Exactly-Does-Youtube-Tv-Entail" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?"></a>What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?</h2><p>YouTube TV, in a nutshell, is a live TV streaming service available in the United States. It’s an Internet-based replacement for cable or satellite television that works on phones, tablets, TVs, and web browsers, allowing you to watch TV, in the same manner you always have from anywhere you have an internet connection, whether at home or on the road.</p><p>When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets. It has also substantially grown its channel library throughout the years. There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.</p><p>Despite its name, YouTube TV is not a part of YouTube; Google maintains both as different companies. However, there are some instances where the two overlap, such as with YouTube Originals, which essentially means that you may end up viewing a few series on both platforms. Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you’ll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-tv-1.jpg"                      alt="youtube tv"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV"><a href="#How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV" class="headerlink" title="How to Watch YouTube TV?"></a>How to Watch YouTube TV?</h2><h4 id="Using-a-computer"><a href="#Using-a-computer" class="headerlink" title="Using a computer"></a>Using a computer</h4><ol><li>Ensure that your computer is on the same Wi-Fi network as Chromecast.</li><li>Open your favorite browser and navigate to tv.youtube.com.</li><li>Choose the show or movie that you wish to watch.</li><li>When the video has loaded, click the Cast icon.

YouTube TV has proven to be one of the greatest live TV streaming services, with an excellent channel selection and an unrivaled user experience, since its introduction in 2017.</p><p>While the price has nearly risen since then, it is still a better option than any of its premium competitors, including Hulu Plus Live TV, FuboTV, and DirecTV Stream. Aside from channels, YouTube TV is simple to use, stylish, and fast on a range of TV and mobile devices. Its cloud DVR is the best in the business, with unlimited storage and nearly all of the features of a hardware DVR like TiVo.</p><h4 id="What-can-you-get-from-YouTube-TV"><a href="#What-can-you-get-from-YouTube-TV" class="headerlink" title="What can you get from YouTube TV?"></a>What can you get from YouTube TV?</h4><p>YouTube TV is distinct from YouTube, the free video site with over 2 billion monthly users. With live channels and on-demand programmers available on a variety of devices, YouTube TV offers a similar experience to cable television. It is compatible with Apple TV, Roku, Android TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV, and various other smart TVs, phones, tablets, and web browsers.</p><h4 id="Which-networks-are-supported-by-Youtube-TV"><a href="#Which-networks-are-supported-by-Youtube-TV" class="headerlink" title="Which networks are supported by Youtube TV?"></a>Which networks are supported by Youtube TV?</h4><p>YouTube TV allows you to watch live and local sports, news, and entertainment from more than 70 channels, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, HGTV, TNT, and others. YouTube TV also offers local and regional content, providing complete local network coverage in over 98 percent of US TV households. YouTube TV is an online streaming service that allows customers to watch live television on computers, phones, and other compatible devices. It requires a high-speed internet connection and is a practical alternative to cable television for those wishing to cut the cord.</p><p>YouTube TV offers a variety of paid add-on channels. These are channels that need a fee in addition to the regular YouTube TV fee. However, this is the greatest method for accessing uncut and unedited movies on YouTube TV.</p><p>The following are among the premium add-on channels available on YouTube TV:</p><p>ALLBLK ($5 per month), AMC+ ($7 per month), Acorn TV ($6 per month), Cinemax ($10 per month), ($5&#x2F;month) Comedy Dynamics, CONtv ($5 per month), CuriosityStream ($3 per month), Docurama ($5 per month), Dove ($5 per month), EPIX ($6 per month), Fandor ($4 per month), Fox Nation ($6 per month), Hallmark Movies Now ($6 per month) and so on.</p><h4 id="Price-and-Add-ons-for-Youtube-TV"><a href="#Price-and-Add-ons-for-Youtube-TV" class="headerlink" title="Price and Add-ons for Youtube TV"></a>Price and Add-ons for Youtube TV</h4><p>The current monthly fee for YouTube TV is USD 65, Plus tax, which brings the total to around $72 each month)</p><p>That isn’t to imply that’s the only price you’ll ever pay for YouTube TV. It has various alternative add-ons that offer you access to even more episodes, movies, and sports for a cost. The option to view some shows and sports in 4K on YouTube TV is a new huge one.</p><p>The following are the optional add-ons for YouTube TV:</p><h4 id="4k-plus-20-per-month-after-a-one-month-trial-9-99-for-the-first-year-for-early-adopters"><a href="#4k-plus-20-per-month-after-a-one-month-trial-9-99-for-the-first-year-for-early-adopters" class="headerlink" title="4k plus ($20 per month after a one-month trial; $9.99 for the first year for early adopters)"></a>4k plus ($20 per month after a one-month trial; $9.99 for the first year for early adopters)</h4><p>On-demand shows and series such as What We Do in the Shadows, Struggle Meals, American Titans, Snowfall, and others fall under this category.

This is due to a variety of circumstances. YouTube TV is simple to use. It has a channel lineup that is competitive with all of the others.</p><p>In addition, the YouTube TV price is reasonable. You can watch YouTube TV on almost any current gadget. And the fact that parent company Alphabet (aka Google) has been heavily marketing it over the last few years hasn’t hurt either.</p><p>A lot is going on with YouTube TV, and it’s only gotten better with time.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Watch YouTube TV?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Is Youtube Tv A Good Investment?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Frequently Asked Questions About Youtube TV</a></p><h2 id="What-Exactly-Does-Youtube-Tv-Entail-3"><a href="#What-Exactly-Does-Youtube-Tv-Entail-3" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?"></a>What Exactly Does Youtube Tv Entail?</h2><p>YouTube TV, in a nutshell, is a live TV streaming service available in the United States. It’s an Internet-based replacement for cable or satellite television that works on phones, tablets, TVs, and web browsers, allowing you to watch TV, in the same manner you always have from anywhere you have an internet connection, whether at home or on the road.</p><p>When it first started in 2017, YouTube TV was limited to a small number of areas in the United States. That changed in 2019 when a significant expansion included support for all 210 markets. It has also substantially grown its channel library throughout the years. There are currently over 85 stations available on YouTube TV, including four major national broadcasters: ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox.</p><p>Despite its name, YouTube TV is not a part of YouTube; Google maintains both as different companies. However, there are some instances where the two overlap, such as with YouTube Originals, which essentially means that you may end up viewing a few series on both platforms. Nonetheless, YouTube TV is not the same as YouTube, and you’ll need two apps on your streaming device to access both.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/youtube-tv-1.jpg"                      alt="youtube tv"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV-3"><a href="#How-to-Watch-YouTube-TV-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Watch YouTube TV?"></a>How to Watch YouTube TV?</h2><h4 id="Using-a-computer-3"><a href="#Using-a-computer-3" class="headerlink" title="Using a computer"></a>Using a computer</h4><ol><li>Ensure that your computer is on the same Wi-Fi network as Chromecast.</li><li>Open your favorite browser and navigate to tv.youtube.com.</li><li>Choose the show or movie that you wish to watch.</li><li>When the video has loaded, click the Cast icon.

Aside from channels, YouTube TV is simple to use, stylish, and fast on a range of TV and mobile devices. Its cloud DVR is the best in the business, with unlimited storage and nearly all of the features of a hardware DVR like TiVo.</p><h4 id="What-can-you-get-from-YouTube-TV-3"><a href="#What-can-you-get-from-YouTube-TV-3" class="headerlink" title="What can you get from YouTube TV?"></a>What can you get from YouTube TV?</h4><p>YouTube TV is distinct from YouTube, the free video site with over 2 billion monthly users.

The apps listed above help you in this, and you can easily prepare attractive and engaging short clips pretty quickly using any of them. However, the most recommended, widely used, and the much-appreciated program is Wondershare Filmora that is not merely limited to mobile application-level features, it even has tools that usually compete with those available in the desktop software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-navigating-through-the-top-10-making-magic-on-youtube/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating Through the Top 10 Making Magic on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/unmatched-ai-tools-for-visual-storytelling-for-2024/"><u>Unmatched AI Tools for Visual Storytelling for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/1713961803092-updated-bored-with-those-normal-background-images-and-that-ordinary-still-capture-feel-take-your-creativity-to-the-next-level-with-amazing-image-transparenc/"><u>Updated Bored with Those Normal Background Images and that Ordinary Still Capture Feel?

You get entertained and also have a chance to share your videos with the world. Among the popular apps are TikTok and Shorts. TikTok got to the market earlier but has so far found a new competitor in the field. Shorts video has now fully emerged from YouTube and has almost the same playing ground. But it is still unclear whether <strong>YouTube Shorts and TikTok</strong> are comparable. While TikTok has over 2 billion downloads, YouTube, on the other hand, already has a massive audience for the tough tussle.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts give both creators and viewers the chance to share short videos for entertainment and promotional purposes. However, they are different in various aspects. Both the apps have their disadvantages and advantages, depending on a user’s preference. Dive into the next section to discover whether TikTok’s impact is about to be threatened by YouTube Shorts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shorts-tiktok-compare.png"                      alt="compare youtube shorts with tiktok"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</a></p><h2 id="Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing"><a href="#Are-YouTube-Shorts-and-Tiktok-the-same-thing" class="headerlink" title="Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?"></a>Are YouTube Shorts and Tiktok the same thing?</h2><p>Shorts and TikTok are not the same in various ways. TikTok first emerged in the market way before Shorts. TikTok was initially known as musically; and later revamped fully as TikTok in 2016. It immediately gained a massive audience worldwide. This is what brought about competition from other apps, trying to replicate TikTok. Apps like Instagram and Facebook added some functionality to their platform to no match. Finally, YouTube pulled it off in 2020, rolling its version of Short videos but in beta version. These two apps have adequate similarities and differences.</p><p>They are both for short-form videos and allow creators to add music from audio libraries. You can also earn some good bucks with these two apps. However, they differ in some aspects. As Shorts can only be 15-seconds long, TikTok can go as long as three minutes. You can also view TikTok directly from its app while for Shorts, you need a separate app, YouTube.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage"><a href="#YouTube-Shorts-TikTok-Which-one-Should-You-Choose-for-Personal-Usage" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?"></a>YouTube Shorts &amp; TikTok: Which one Should You Choose for Personal Usage?</h2><p>Let’s focus on the TikTok and Shorts video by perusing the similarities and differences deeply.</p><h3 id="Similiarity"><a href="#Similiarity" class="headerlink" title="- Similiarity"></a>- Similiarity</h3><p>Check out in which aspects TikTok and Shorts are similar to each other.</p><h5 id="1-Monetization"><a href="#1-Monetization" class="headerlink" title="1) Monetization"></a>1) Monetization</h5><p>Both platforms provide creators with tools to earn money from their content. TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics"><a href="#2-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy"><a href="#4-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.</p><h5 id="5-Edit-video"><a href="#5-Edit-video" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit video"></a>5) Edit video</h5><p>There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.</p><h3 id="Difference"><a href="#Difference" class="headerlink" title="- Difference"></a>- Difference</h3><h5 id="1-Instant-messaging-app"><a href="#1-Instant-messaging-app" class="headerlink" title="1) Instant messaging app"></a>1) Instant messaging app</h5><p>Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability"><a href="#2-In-dependability" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface"><a href="#3-Interface" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><h3 id="What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need"><a href="#What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need" class="headerlink" title="- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need"></a>- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need</h3><p>Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen.

Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics-3"><a href="#2-Analytics-3" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators-3"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy-3"><a href="#4-Privacy-3" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.</p><h5 id="5-Edit-video-3"><a href="#5-Edit-video-3" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit video"></a>5) Edit video</h5><p>There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion. Also, you can set timers to help with the filming process among other functionalities.</p><h3 id="Difference-3"><a href="#Difference-3" class="headerlink" title="- Difference"></a>- Difference</h3><h5 id="1-Instant-messaging-app-3"><a href="#1-Instant-messaging-app-3" class="headerlink" title="1) Instant messaging app"></a>1) Instant messaging app</h5><p>Generally, YouTube is not a traditional social media platform. Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability-3"><a href="#2-In-dependability-3" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface-3"><a href="#3-Interface-3" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><h3 id="What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need-3"><a href="#What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need-3" class="headerlink" title="- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need"></a>- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need</h3><p>Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music.

This app will save your time and effort while giving you compelling video outcomes. Filmora comprises advanced features such as social import to let you import video clips and photos from social media platforms.

If you are looking for <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >short video promotion on YouTube Shorts and Tiktok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you may need to consider different things. Yes, Shorts has some upper hand over TikTok like the ability to edit your videos after being published, a dislike button, and a scheduling tool that lets you schedule when your video goes live. TikTok is still above the cut being that it has been here long before Shorts. More so, it offers advanced editing features for quality video output. Above all, it works independently, a feature that most users adore as compared to the encasing of Shorts within YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

Logan Paul</h4><p><strong>Earnings:</strong> $12.5 million</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> 19 million</p><p>The vlogger who caught the public eye with the recent Japanese suicide incident hasn’t lost much of his YouTube subscribers despite his controversial behavior. As a matter of fact, his popularity seems to be on the rise at the moment since his videos got over 3 billion views in the three years since he started his YouTube channel. However, this may only be a fluke and his popularity may plummet if he continues to produce shocking but mediocre videos.</p><p>His daredevil style has launched this 22-year old to YouTube stardom, but as time passes it will be hard for Logan to maintain this level of success.</p><h4 id="6-Felix-Arvid-Ulf-Kjellberg-YouTube-Channel-PewDiePie"><a href="#6-Felix-Arvid-Ulf-Kjellberg-YouTube-Channel-PewDiePie" class="headerlink" title="6.

There’s nothing to get nervous about when you have expert tips on how to shoot a perfect makeup tutorial:</p><ol><li>Make sure you sit facing a window from where the sun is shining through so that it provides a soft natural glow to your face.</li><li>Ensure there’s a continuous stream of light, which hardly flickers or distorts. Set up a ring light to mimic the natural light.</li><li>To justify the colors of your work and make them pop on your skin, surround yourself with LED luminosity attached with reflectors to disperse the rays evenly throughout the room. This shall keep away the shadows from swallowing you.</li><li>Assure quality audio by upgrading to camera mics or simply switch to a reliable audio software for getting the work done.</li><li>Edit out the awkward moments from the shoot, add interesting transitions and effects by narrowing down to a reliable video editing software. Filmora can be a wonderful tool to fine-tune your video, add endless effects, remove background noise (if any) and provide you with full 4K support. And the best thing about it is that it’s free for beginners!</li></ol><h3 id="Custom-Your-Makeup-Videos-with-Excellent-Video-Editing-Tool"><a href="#Custom-Your-Makeup-Videos-with-Excellent-Video-Editing-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Custom Your Makeup Videos with Excellent Video Editing Tool"></a>Custom Your Makeup Videos with Excellent Video Editing Tool</h3><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="Wrapping-Up"><a href="#Wrapping-Up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h3><p>All you have to do is subscribe to the channels of all the compiled YouTube makeup artists for real-time updates.
