Having an attractive and eye-catching thumbnail is one of those top factors that contribute to the growth of your channel. No matter how good your content is, if you cannot attract users to click on your videos, it will not benefit your channel. In this article, we are going to show you how you can make a Fortnite thumbnail in few simple steps using Filmora X. If you are a content creator and love to make Fortnite videos, then this article will be very helpful for you.</p><p>Filmora has recently introduced a new feature named AI Portrait that uses Artificial Intelligence to remove the background from a portrait or image. This feature doesn’t require any green screen to do that. Filmora also contains a wide range of elements and titles that help you enhance the Thumbnail and make look stunning and eye-catching.</p><hr><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> To start making a Fortnite thumbnail, it is important to have a screenshot of your gameplay. We can make a perfect screenshot using Fortnite Replay Mode. If you have recently played a Fortnite match, you can access its replay under the Career tab. Under the Career tab select Replays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> If you are using a console, the game will only store 10 recent gameplays, but if you are using a PC, it will store 100 recent gameplays in this section. From all these gameplays, select the one that you want to use for the Thumbnail. Once you choose gameplay, you can control everything in it. The angle, speed, and camera mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> For creating a perfect thumbnail, select “Drone Free Camera” mode from the camera mode located on the bottom right corner of the screen. It will allow us to change the angle the way we want. Choose an angle of your choice and take the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> Open Filmora X, make sure to select the 16:9 screen ratio. Import the screenshot using the import button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 05:</strong> Drag and drop the screenshot into the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 06:</strong> Now, let’s separate the background and character. Go to the Effects, then AI Portrait, select Human Segmentation, and drop it into the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step6"                ></p><p><strong>Step 07:</strong> Filmora will ask you to purchase it, but you can now hit “Try it” to use it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step7"                ></p><p><strong>Step 08:</strong> It will remove the background of the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 09:</strong> To add a background, go to the media and navigate to “Sample Color.” Drag a color of your choice and drop it below the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step9"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> To add titles in the Thumbnail, go to the Titles tab. Here you can find several categories of titles. Find your preferred title and drop it above all the layers. You can choose titles, lower thirds, and other texts depending upon your need and requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step10"                ></p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> We can make this Fortnite Thumbnail look more attractive by adding elements such as stickers and icons. Filmora contains a wide range of stickers. To access them, navigate to the Elements tab. Here you can find so many categories of elements. Choose any elements according to your need and drop them in the timeline above all other layers. If you cannot find a suitable sticker, you can download one from the internet and use it by importing it into Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Once you are satisfied with the final results, you can take the screenshot of the Thumbnail using the Snapshot icon located below the preview panel. It will create a screenshot in the media panel of Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step12"                ></p><p><strong>Step 13:</strong> To access the directory where this screenshot is saved, right-click on the screenshot and click on “Reveal in Explorer.” It will open the folder that contains all the screenshots you take through Filmora. Your Fortnite Thumbnail is ready to be used on your Youtube videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step13"                ></p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>With Filmora, there are no limits.

You can compose this shot with different kinds of lenses for your interchangeable lens camera.</p><p>But which kind of lens is the right lens for you as a vlogger?</p><p>In this article, I’m going to help you figure that out.</p><ul><li><a href="#ThreeFocalLengthGroups">Part 1: Three Focal Length Groups: Wide, Standard, Telephoto</a></li><li><a href="#VloggingWithEachFocalLengthGroup">Part 2: Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group</a></li><li><a href="#CropFactor">Part 3: Crop Factor</a></li><li><a href="#FocalLengthEquivalencyTable">Part 4: Focal Length Equivalency Table</a></li><li><a href="#aperture">Part 5: Aperture</a></li><li><a href="#VloggingWithAFastLens">Part 6: Vlogging With a Fast Lens</a></li><li><a href="#OpticalImageStabilization">Part 7: Optical Image Stabilization</a></li></ul><h3 id="Three-Focal-Length-Groups-Wide-Standard-Telephoto"><a href="#Three-Focal-Length-Groups-Wide-Standard-Telephoto" class="headerlink" title="Three Focal Length Groups: Wide, Standard, Telephoto"></a>Three Focal Length Groups: Wide, Standard, Telephoto</h3><p>There are three main ranges in focal lengths that camera lenses can be categorized into wide, standard, and telephoto.</p><h4 id="Wide-Angle-Lens"><a href="#Wide-Angle-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Wide-Angle Lens"></a>Wide-Angle Lens</h4><p>Wide-angle lenses can “see more.” They allow more of your scene to fit inside your frame. Objects that are closer to the lens appear much bigger while objects that are further away appear even smaller. Perspectives are also enhanced, making close objects and people that just make it into the sides of the frame appear more stretched out. Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, wide-angle lenses will appear the least zoomed in.</p><h4 id="Standard-Lens"><a href="#Standard-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Standard Lens"></a>Standard Lens</h4><p>With standard lenses or normal lenses, you won’t get the stretched out objects or enhanced perspectives that you get from wide-angle lenses. Instead, standard lenses are meant to see scenes as the natural human eye is meant to see them. If you shoot a scene with both a wide-angle lens and a standard lens from the same position, you’ll notice that less of the scene fits into your frame. Standard lenses will appear more zoomed-in than wide-angle lenses, but less zoomed-in than telephoto lenses.</p><h4 id="Telephoto-Lens"><a href="#Telephoto-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Telephoto Lens"></a>Telephoto Lens</h4><p>Out of all the other ranges in focal lengths, telephoto lenses will appear the most zoomed in. This can be beneficial for the shooter who wants to get a closer shot of a scene without having to physically be in close proximity to the scene. Objects that are further away in the background also appear larger and closer than they would appear on wide-angle or standard lenses.</p><h3 id="Vlogging-With-Each-Focal-Length-Group"><a href="#Vlogging-With-Each-Focal-Length-Group" class="headerlink" title="Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group"></a>Vlogging With Each Focal Length Group</h3><p>You can get your talking head footage using lenses from any of the three focal length groups. Depending on how you plan to vlog most of the time, though, one of the three focal lengths might be more suitable for you.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-wide-angle-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-wide-angle-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a wide-angle lens"></a>When to vlog with a wide-angle lens</h4><p>Wide-angle lenses are the most commonly used lenses for vlogging. Wide-angle lenses are great when you need to be close to your camera. This might be the case for you if your recording space is small or if you want to film yourself as you hold your camera up with your own hand.</p><p>Being close to your camera not only gives you the option to use your camera’s built-in microphone, but it also gives you the option to make use of camera-mounted shotgun microphones.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-standard-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-standard-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a standard lens"></a>When to vlog with a standard lens</h4><p>Standard lenses are great when you have more space to be further away from your camera. The perspectives in your shot will look more natural through a standard lens, making your talking head footage feel more corporate or professional. You’ll also be able to get blurrier backgrounds using a standard lens versus a wide-angle lens.</p><p>Being further away from your camera, however, means that you’ll have to use a separate microphone positioned closer to you.</p><h4 id="When-to-vlog-with-a-telephoto-lens"><a href="#When-to-vlog-with-a-telephoto-lens" class="headerlink" title="When to vlog with a telephoto lens"></a>When to vlog with a telephoto lens</h4><p>As telephoto lenses are even more zoomed in, you’ll need to be even further away from your camera to fit yourself inside your camera frame. Why would any vlogger ever need to be that far away from their camera? One word… teleprompter. If you want or need to stick to a script, you’ll have to be far away enough from your camera that it doesn’t appear like your eyes are scanning left to right. You then close in the distance with a telephoto lens.</p><p>  In the above video, Marcos Rocha compares different focal lengths for talking head videos. Which focal length range do you like the look of?</p><h3 id="Crop-Factor"><a href="#Crop-Factor" class="headerlink" title="Crop Factor"></a>Crop Factor</h3><p>Focal lengths in camera lenses are measured in millimeters. You can vlog yourself handheld with a 24mm lens on a camera with a full-frame sensor (the sensor is the piece of hardware inside your camera that turns the light it receives into a digital image). But if you use a 24mm lens on a camera with a smaller sensor, like an APS-C sensor or even smaller Micro 4&#x2F;3 sensor, more of you will get cropped out (see below).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-crop-factor.jpg"                      alt="Crop Factor"                ></p><p> In order to make up for the cropping that occurs, you will need to use a wider lens on cameras with smaller sensors to get the same shot you’d get with a full-frame camera.</p><h3 id="Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table"><a href="#Focal-Length-Equivalency-Table" class="headerlink" title="Focal Length Equivalency Table"></a>Focal Length Equivalency Table</h3><p>This table shows you the focal lengths needed to achieve the same shot between cameras with different sensor sizes. In order to take a shot as wide as the shot I took of myself with the 24mm lens on my full-frame camera, I would need a 15mm lens on an APS-C sensor camera or a 12mm lens on a micro 4&#x2F;3 camera.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Focal Length &#x2F; Sensor</th><th>Full Frame</th><th>APS-C</th><th>Micro 4&#x2F;3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>16mm</td><td>10mm</td><td>8mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>18mm</td><td>11mm</td><td>9mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide (Handheld Selfie-Safe)</td><td>24mm</td><td>15mm</td><td>12mm</td></tr><tr><td>Wide</td><td>35mm</td><td>22mm</td><td>18mm</td></tr><tr><td>Standard</td><td>50mm</td><td>31mm</td><td>25mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>70mm</td><td>44mm</td><td>35mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>100mm</td><td>63mm</td><td>50mm</td></tr><tr><td>Telephoto</td><td>200mm</td><td>125mm</td><td>100mm</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Aperture"><a href="#Aperture" class="headerlink" title="Aperture"></a>Aperture</h3><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture.jpg"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture"                ></p><p> The next thing to consider when you’re looking for a lens is the aperture, the hole (often adjustable) within the lens that lets light in. Aperture for camera lenses is measured in f-stops (f&#x2F;1.4, f&#x2F;1.8, f&#x2F;2.0) - the smaller the f-stop number, the larger the aperture (bigger hole letting even more light in).</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lenses-aperture-range.png"                      alt="Camera lenses Aperture Range"                ></p><p> Because larger aperture lenses let more light in, they need a shorter time for cameras to compose an image. This is why larger aperture lenses are also called “fast” lenses.</p><p>Fast lenses are more expensive because they cost more to produce. There’s a lot more that goes into them, including larger and higher quality glass elements.</p><p>But do you even need a fast lens?</p><h3 id="Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h3><h4 id="Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Pros-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Pros of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>Better low-light performance</li><li>Better autofocus performance</li><li>Better “bokeh” (out-of-focus areas, like your background, having that nice blurry look that you see in a lot of movies)</li></ul><h4 id="Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens"><a href="#Cons-of-Vlogging-With-a-Fast-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens"></a>Cons of Vlogging With a Fast Lens</h4><ul><li>More expensive</li><li>Moving subjects more likely to get out of focus when shooting with a large aperture</li><li>Better continuous autofocus performance needed when shooting moving subjects with a large aperture</li></ul><h3 id="Optical-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#Optical-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="Optical Image Stabilization"></a>Optical Image Stabilization</h3><p>Finally, you’ll have to decide whether or not you want your lens to have built-in optical image stabilization (OIS).</p><p>OIS is very beneficial to have on a lens if you’re a vlogger who films mostly handheld footage. Although this technology adds to the price of your lens as well, it can greatly help you to capture smoother footage that may otherwise be shaky. Nikon calls this technology “Vibration Reduction” (VR) for their lenses.</p><p>  In the above video, you can see how much OIS can help to stabilize your footage. MicBergsma simultaneously compares the footage between two GoPro Hero5 Blacks, one with OIS on and one with OIS off.</p><p>If, however, you are shooting most of your vlogs on a tripod, you won’t need a lens with OIS.</p><p> Looking for ways to set up your talking-head shot for YouTube with any of these lenses?

It came out only a few months ago and is already considered one of the best mirrorless cameras for vlogging. The M50 is also the only camera on our list that you can buy at a prosumer’s budget that shoots 4K video. Yes, the Sony a7R III and Panasonic GH5S also shoot 4K video, but they are much more expensive. With Canon’s new DIGIC 8 Image Processor, the camera’s dual-pixel autofocusing system will perform even better.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Can shoot UHD 4K videos at 23.98 fps</em> <em>- Has a 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No image stabilization</em> <em>- Battery life could be longer</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-4.png"                      alt="Mirrorless Cameras 4"                ></td><td>Best entry-level mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M100 The Canon EOS M100 is a small, but powerful mirrorless camera for vlogging. This camera can shoot full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. It cannot shoot 4K video, unfortunately. It uses its DIGIC 7 Image Processor and dual-pixel autofocusing system to ensure that your vlogs are always in focus. The M100 provides great ISO sensitivity options - it can reach up to ISO 25600. With its built-in Wi-Fi with NFC, you can transfer your media seamlessly to a computer.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Affordable</em> <em>- Great connectivity options</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Lacks advanced video recording features</em> <em>- No viewfinder</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-1.png"                      alt="Mirrorless Cameras 1"                ></td><td>Best mid-range mirrorless camera for vlogging: Canon EOS M50 The Canon EOS M50 wins this category as well in our books. It is the only camera on our list that shoots 4K video that is priced much lower than the Sony a7R III and the Panasonic GH7S. In case you missed it, check out my review on the <a href="#Best-daily-mirrorless-camera-for-vlogging">Canon EOS M50</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mirrorless-cameras-2.png"                      alt="Mirrorless Cameras 2"                ></td><td>Best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging: Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5S Originally, Panasonic had released it’s GH5 as a hybrid camera that handles both photography and videography well. In response to hearing customers’ interest in a more video-focused camera, Panasonic came up with the GH5S. In our list of the top mirrorless cameras, the Panasonic GH5S and the Sony a7R III are the two professional mirrorless cameras that can record 4K video. Between the two, though, the GH5S wins as the best professional mirrorless camera for vlogging because it sports a fully-articulated screen. Its micro four-thirds sensor is smaller than the a7R III’s full-frame sensor. Even with a smaller sensor, though, the GH5S is made to still autofocus well in low lighting conditions. Another amazing feature is its ability to record 240 fps slow-motion video at full HD 1080p.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- ISO sensitivity goes up to 204800</em> <em>- High video bit rates</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Expensive</em> <em>- The camera body weighs about 1.5 lbs</em></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Want to compare even more cameras?

The most crucial part of making a video is editing. This is the part where you have to look at every intricate detail. This is the part where you remove unwanted footage and place useful shots in their position. Every creator has their editing style by which they put their mark on their videos.</p><p>Editing can be a long and tedious process. It takes time, patience, and an immense amount of creativity to create a video good enough to impress the viewers. Here are few tips that will make your editing process easier and cut your editing time in half.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Video-Editing-Tips-for-YouTube-Beginners"><a href="#Top-10-Video-Editing-Tips-for-YouTube-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Video Editing Tips for YouTube Beginners"></a>Top 10 Video Editing Tips for YouTube Beginners</h2><p>The following will not tell you how to edit your YouTube videos, but will surely make editing a little more convenient.</p><h3 id="1-Choose-a-Good-Video-Editor"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Good-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Good Video Editor"></a>1. Choose a Good Video Editor</h3><p>One of the first things you have to do is make sure that you have chosen a video editor that is best for you.</p><p>Using either too complicated or too basic a video editor can only create problems for you. An advanced video editor may create very high-end, professional videos, but it will take months just to get the hang of the software. Whereas a free basic video editor may not give as many options as you’d need to edit your videos properly.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Fast-Computers"><a href="#2-Use-Fast-Computers" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Fast Computers"></a>2. Use Fast Computers</h3><p>Being a video creator, you’ll have to store numerous huge files on your computer. To improve your current PC, you can invest in an SSD, which is a lot faster than the traditional hard disk.</p><p>SSD will not only improve your export, loading, and rendering time but it will allow you to access files and editing software much faster. Another improvement you can make to make your editing process faster is to increase the RAM of your computer (it should be at least 8 GB).

Whether it is background music or a soundtrack in between shots, it has to pair well with your video.</p><p>If you are on a budget and don’t want to spend money on music, there are royalty-free options available. But, know that good music only comes at a price.</p><h3 id="6-Add-Text-Titles-and-Graphics"><a href="#6-Add-Text-Titles-and-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="6.

New technologies and features like AI (artificial intelligence), AR (augmented reality) have made possible things we couldn’t even imagine at the turn of the century.</p><p>Scroll down to find out this infographic made by <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. And get to know more about the hottest social media trends in 2018 and feel free to let us know what you think in the comments section. Hit share and tell your friends and colleagues about the future of the Internet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-social-media-trends-2018.jpg"                      alt="top social media trends 2018"                ></p><p>In 2017, 90% of all content shared by Internet users is <strong>video</strong>, and this trend will continue in 2018 because all of the most popular social networks are investing in video features because they believe it can help them generate better user engagement. Furthermore, the ephemeral content, the type of content that is available for less than 24 hours, is on the rise, which means that Instagram or Snapchat stories must be considered as a channel for brand promotion in the next year and in years to come.</p><p><strong>Chatbots</strong> represent a significant force on the market since 80% of chatbots can be utilized for providing non-stop services. Some estimations say that up to 30% of all chat conversations on the Internet will be with chatbots as soon as 2018. Despite the rapid automatization of the Internet, influencers still play a large role in online marketing, and they will continue to do so because they can produce a ten-time rise in conversion rates. Over 90% of people who at one point used influencer marketing think that it is an effective marketing technique that almost certainly provides results.</p><p>One force on the market that needs to be reckoned with are <strong>Smartphones</strong>. The amount of time an average internet user spends on social networks from their Smartphone is significantly larger than the amount of time spent on those same networks from a desktop computer. This means that optimizing online content for Smartphones will become even more important in 2018, than it already is.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming Takes the Center Stage</strong>. Some studies have shown that 80% of customers would prefer to watch a live video streamed by a brand than to read a post. To make things even more interesting, it is estimated that by 2020 80% of Internet traffic will be generated by video content and the video streaming market could easily become $70,5 billion industry by 2021 if its growth continues at this pace.</p><p>As of today <strong>Generation Z</strong> already has $44 billion of buying power and this number will continue to grow as the time passes. For that reason, brands and companies will have to adjust their offers to meet the demands of this rising force on the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/nlocking-your-audience-youtube-subscriber-insights/"><u>[New] Unlocking Your Audience  YouTube Subscriber Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/rive-engagement-crafting-an-animated-subscribe-button-in-filmoras-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[New] Drive Engagement  Crafting an Animated Subscribe Button in Filmora's Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-saving-youtube-tracks-and-dialogues/"><u>2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to Saving YouTube Tracks & Dialogues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-priority-picks-high-rated-graphics-cards-for-seamless-playback/"><u>2024 Approved  Priority Picks  High-Rated Graphics Cards for Seamless Playback</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/treamline-profitability-on-yt-post-monetization-financial-steps-for-2024/"><u>[New] Streamline Profitability on YT – Post-Monetization Financial Steps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ree-visual-templates-to-upgrade-your-profile/"><u>[New] Free Visual Templates to Upgrade Your Profile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-unlocking-high-quality-videos-youtubes-enhancement-secrets-revealed/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlocking High-Quality Videos  YouTube's Enhancement Secrets Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-innovating-sustainable-communities-within-the-concrete-jungle/"><u>In 2024, Innovating Sustainable Communities Within the Concrete Jungle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-streamline-your-impact-the-most-effective-video-formats-for-youtube/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Streamline Your Impact  The Most Effective Video Formats for YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-speedy-tactics-for-disorganized-youtube-song-listings/"><u>In 2024, Speedy Tactics for Disorganized YouTube Song Listings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/initial-visual-journey-review-with-additional-paths-for-2024/"><u>Initial Visual Journey Review with Additional Paths for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-the-best-highlight-reel-software/"><u>Updated Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Best Highlight Reel Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-becoming-a-master-of-instagram-auditory-aesthetics/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Becoming a Master of Instagram Auditory Aesthetics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/soaring-with-mi-drone-an-in-depth-4k-study-for-2024/"><u>Soaring with MI Drone -

Even if listening to music with static backgrounds isn’t commonplace, including a video can’t hurt. Everything will be determined by your editing and design abilities. If you’re working on a simple project, adding some effects can help it stand out. To achieve this, there are a variety of software options available; pick one that best suits your needs. Today, we would like to recommend Filmora to you.</p><p>The songs in YouTube’s library can be used for both personal and commercial purposes. Any of the songs in Filmora’s library can be used in any way you like. There is no need for acknowledgment of non-commercial use, but you should aware that commercial use may not be permitted.</p><p>Moreover, Filmora is far more sophisticated than Windows Movie Maker and iMovie on Mac. It also allows you to create a professional-looking YouTube video with hundreds of presets such as filters, overlays, components, transitions, and blending several layers of effects and audio to enhance your YouTube tale.</p><p>Adding music to your video might help it go from excellent to extraordinary. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding music to your YouTube videos. Knowing how to incorporate music into your YouTube videos can significantly improve the quality of your content. The majority of videos uploaded to YouTube have never been edited in any way.</p><p>This is due in part to a lack of experience, but it is also related to a lack of awareness. Including music in your films is an easy method to boost productivity, attract more viewers, and keep them watching for longer. It’s also simple to do straight within YouTube, albeit this isn’t the ideal option in the long run. So, here are a few options for adding music to YouTube videos by Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step is to figure out where you want to put the audio</p><p>Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website and run it on your computer. After the software has been launched, go to ‘MEDIA’ and then to the ‘IMPORT’ option, which is located directly below the navigation bar. Now, select ‘Import Media Files’ from the drop-down menu to choose the video file, and then repeat the process to select the desired background music file.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Adding music to a timeline</p><p>Hover your mouse over the audio and video files you just imported into Filmora, and then hit the ‘+’ sign (‘Add to Project’ will appear). You may also move the media files to the timeline by dragging them down.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make changes to the music file</p><p>By double-tapping the audio from the timeline, you can edit the music. The audio panel will appear at the top of the screen. You may fade in or out the audio, adjust the volume, pitch, and speed, and select suitable equalization.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Export your work</p><p>After you’ve made the adjustments you want to your movie, click the ‘EXPORT’ tab on the toolbar to export it. The produced file can be renamed, saved in.MP4 and.WMV formats, and set the resolution.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h4 id="Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos"><a href="#Bouns-Where-Can-I-Find-Music-For-Youtube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Bouns!

The songs include both traditional public domain and generic royalty-free music. Your selections will be limited if you’re adding (or replacing) music directly from YouTube. This is why pre-editing your videos is the most pleasing thing you can do for them. This will enable you to add bespoke music from services.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● We hope you now have a better concept of how to post your song to YouTube if you’ve ever wondered.

All you need to do to access it is, sign in to your Google account, tap the <strong>+</strong> button at the bottom, and tap <strong>Create a Short</strong> in the popup box that comes up.</p><ol><li><strong>What if YouTube Shorts is not showing on my YouTube app?</strong></li></ol><p>Make sure that your YouTube app is updated to its latest version. If the app is already updated, and <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still unavailable, the chances are that Google hasn’t rolled the app in your region. Since <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is still in its Beta phase, only the region of India can use all the functions of the app at the time of this writing. In such a case, you are suggested to wait until the <strong>YouTube Shorts app</strong> is made available for your location.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts video duration?</strong></li></ol><p>A <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> video can be of only up to 60 seconds.</p><ol><li><strong>What’s the YouTube Shorts size limitation?</strong></li></ol><p>YouTube hasn’t provided any information related to this as of now. However, you can rest assure that a 60 seconds long video file wouldn’t be too large for YouTube to handle.</p><ol><li><strong>How many subs do you need to access Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p><strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> is available for everyone regardless of the number of subscribers the channel has.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you make money on Shorts?</strong></li></ol><p>Unfortunately, NO. Although you cannot monetize the recordings published as <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong>, they can be a good source to drive subscribers to your main YouTube channel that may have the videos that can be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-how-to-quickly-and-easily-share-a-youtube-playlist/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Quickly And Easily Share A YouTube Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-optimal-income-mastering-youtube-channel-profitability-on-mobile/"><u>[Updated] Optimal Income  Mastering YouTube Channel Profitability on Mobile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/rical-insights-from-youtubes-top-10-vlogs-for-2024/"><u>Historical Insights From YouTube's Top 10 Vlogs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-youtube-content-strategies-skyrocket-your-ranking/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, YouTube Content Strategies  Skyrocket Your Ranking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-igtv-vs-youtube-unveiling-key-distinctions-and-best-platform-for-sharing/"><u>[Updated] IGTV Vs.

The only trouble is that both Instagram and IGTV have very precise <strong>video upload requirements</strong>, so each video you want to share on your IGTV channel must be <strong>saved in MP4 file format and in a 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>.</p><p>YouTube videos, on the other hand, are mostly horizontally oriented. If you attempt to <strong>upload a YouTube video to IGTV</strong> and wondering how to achieve it, just keep reading.

This online video editor offers a number of video editing tools that let you polish your videos before posting them on social media.</p><p>Click on the Resize tool and simply <strong>copy and paste the URL</strong> of a YouTube into the appropriate bar and the platform will <strong>automatically import a video and display it on the screen</strong> once the content is finally fetched.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kapwing-crop-youtube-to-igtv.jpg"                      alt="Kapwing  Crop YouTube video to IGTV"                ></p><p>Pick the <strong>Story (Snap&#x2F;Insta) or IGTV 9:16 option</strong> and then proceed to <strong>choose the background color for your IGTV video, increase or decrease the zoom level or change the position of the video</strong>. Click on the <strong>Create button</strong> when ready and wait for Kapwing to process your video. <strong>All videos you create with the free version of this online video editor are going to be watermarked</strong> and you have to pay a six-dollar fee for each watermark-free video you edit with Kapwing or you can opt for a $20 monthly subscription fee that enables you to export an unlimited amount of videos without watermarks each month.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-youtube-video-convert-to-igtv.jpg"                      alt="Kapwing  Rotate YouTube video to IGTV"                ></p><p>A growing number of IGTV users choose to rotate their videos, instead of resizing them, so if you already have a YouTube video with a 16:9 aspect ratio you can just rotate it and get a video with a 9:16 aspect ratio. Click on the <strong>Rotate</strong>  option and then rotate it <strong>90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise</strong> and click on the <strong>Create button</strong>. If you opt for this method of creating a vertical video for IGTV, your video will remain the same size, but the viewers will have to hold their phones horizontally in order to view it properly.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Convert MKV to MP4 without Losing Quality [Free Converters Provided] &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Changing-the-Aspect-Ratio-of-a-YouTube-Video-with-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro"></a>Part 3: Changing the Aspect Ratio of a YouTube Video with Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Editing videos with professional video editing software products like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro requires a certain amount of skill. There is more than just one way to change the aspect ratio of a video in Final Cut Pro, but probably the best one is to <strong>set the project resolution to 2160X3840 or any other lower resolution that matches the 9:16 aspect ratio</strong>. During the video editing process, you will have to <strong>resize all of the footage</strong> you want to include in the final version of the video. Planning your shots and composing them differently than you would compose horizontally oriented shots can potentially save you a little time on resizing and repositioning the video clips you’re working with.</p><p>If you’ve already exported a video and uploaded it to your YouTube channel, you can open that video in Final Cut Pro and just rotate it using the Transform tools. However, the viewers will have to hold their phones in a horizontal position while watching the video if you choose this method of creating a 9:16 aspect ratio in Final Cut Pro.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Posting YouTube videos on your IGTV channel is still a somewhat complicated process because you can’t share posts directly from one platform to the other. Moreover, you can’t upload videos that last more than ten minutes to IGTV, unless you have a verified account. Even so, the IGTV platform can help you extend the reach of your videos and increase the revenue you’re generating from the content you’re sharing on social media. Do you know another way of changing a YouTube video’s aspect ratio before re-posting it on IGTV?

There are some points to be considered while creating a thumbnail for Youtube. We will provide you with the best practices that we have learned throughout our journey of using Youtube and growing it from zero.</p><p>7 best practices can help you make your Youtube thumbnail stand out from the crowd and make its way out.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Show-your-face"><a href="#Show-your-face" class="headerlink" title="Show your face"></a>Show your face</h4></li></ol><p>In a world full of machines and computers, people love to listen and interact with people instead of computer-generated voices and a voice without a face. Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png"                      alt="piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg"                      alt="use-phrases-not-sentences"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Put-every-stuff-on-left-side"><a href="#Put-every-stuff-on-left-side" class="headerlink" title="Put every stuff on left side"></a>Put every stuff on left side</h4></li></ol><p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size. Come on, you don’t want your beautiful thumbnail that cost you a few hours be covered. To avoid these icons from hiding your important stuff of thumbnail, make sure to put everything on the right side of your thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/put-stuff-on-left.jpg"                      alt="put-stuff-on-left"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Have-a-unique-and-Consistent-style"><a href="#Have-a-unique-and-Consistent-style" class="headerlink" title="Have a unique and Consistent style"></a>Have a unique and Consistent style</h4></li></ol><p>Try to make all your thumbnails follow the same style. Following the same style for all your Youtube thumbnails will make your channel look unique and all your videos identical. It will be easy for viewers to identify your videos when they see them. It gives your channel a touch of its unique brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unique-and-consistent-style.png"                      alt="unique-and-consistent-style"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-elements-to-grab-the-attention"><a href="#Use-elements-to-grab-the-attention" class="headerlink" title="Use elements to grab the attention"></a>Use elements to grab the attention</h4></li></ol><p>To make your Youtube thumbnail more appealing to the viewers, add circles and arrows to grab viewers’ attention to something very important in the video. It will increase the curiosity in the viewers and make them click your videos to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-elements-to-grab-attention.jpg"                      alt="use-elements-to-grab-attention"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Choose-the-right-tool"><a href="#Choose-the-right-tool" class="headerlink" title="Choose the right tool"></a>Choose the right tool</h4></li></ol><p>This whole process seems to be very hectic and time taking, but do you know, you can do everything on just one software?

I**n reality, your video doesn’t contain any information related to it, you are going to lose their trust. They are never going to click on your videos again. Even if you don’t use such a trick anymore. Try to avoid such activities. Avoiding such activities can make your channel grow in the long term. Only use the text and images that are relevant to your content and stick to that.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Choose-your-preview-window-wisely"><a href="#Choose-your-preview-window-wisely" class="headerlink" title="Choose your preview window wisely"></a>Choose your preview window wisely</h4></li></ol><p>Do you know that Youtube can show a 3-second preview of your video when someone hovers the cursor over it? It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not.

To make a Fortnite thumbnail for free, we are going to use Filmora X. Filmora X contains all kinds of features and elements that are required for a perfect and eye-catching thumbnail. To get started, make sure to download and install the latest version of Filmora X.</p><ol><li>Before we start making Fortnite Thumbnails, we have to take a screenshot of the gameplay. Open Fortnite and go to the Career tab. Here you will find Replays.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1.jpg"                      alt="make-fortnite-thumbnail-step1"                ></p><ol><li>It contains all your recent gameplays.

Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts"></a>3.  Cheap Fitness - No-Equipment At-Home Workouts</h4><p>No one should be forced to pay a fortune just to keep their bodies in shape, and we no longer have to. YouTube videos that show us how to exercise at home without expensive equipment are becoming increasingly popular. Fitness experts can gain a lot of attention from YouTube’s community if they can offer cheap and effective workout techniques anyone can try at home.</p><h4 id="4-Stretch-Videos"><a href="#4-Stretch-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.  Stretch Videos"></a>4.  Stretch Videos</h4><p>Preparation is the key to success in everything, including working out. YouTube videos that teach viewers how to prepare themselves for a workout session can help you get views on YouTube. The best part is that people can always go back to your video anytime they need the warm-up techniques you teach in your videos which means repeat views and increased watch time.</p><h4 id="5-Full-length-Workout-Videos"><a href="#5-Full-length-Workout-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5.  Full-length Workout Videos"></a>5.  Full-length Workout Videos</h4><p>There are so many different fitness techniques out there, and most fitness instructors know more than just one workout technique. Creating a series of YouTube videos that offer detailed information on how to do Pilates, cardio, stretching, or injury rehabilitation exercises could provide you with more than enough material to fill your channel with content. Full-length workout videos show the entire training from the beginning until the end.</p><h4 id="6-Yoga-Routine"><a href="#6-Yoga-Routine" class="headerlink" title="6.  Yoga Routine"></a>6.  Yoga Routine</h4><p>Mastering Yoga is a lengthy process because there are so many different styles of Yoga routines. If you are familiar with the practices of Hasyayoga, Pranayama, or Kundalini Yoga then your YouTube videos can center on the most important exercises from one or all of the different schools of Yoga. Viewers of your yoga routine videos can’t learn all the poses and exercises after watching them just once, which means they’ll keep coming back until they feel confident that they can practice yoga independently.</p><h4 id="7-Exercise-Plans"><a href="#7-Exercise-Plans" class="headerlink" title="7.  Exercise Plans"></a>7.  Exercise Plans</h4><p>We all need to stick to some kind of a plan, no matter what we do. Structuring workouts and giving people a concise plan they should follow when they get to the gym (or in their home) can be beneficial for beginners and experienced athletes alike. These types of videos are ‘evergreen’ – they don’t become dated as time passes so new and returning audiences can continue to appreciate them.</p><h4 id="8-Motivational-Video"><a href="#8-Motivational-Video" class="headerlink" title="8.  Motivational Video"></a>8.  Motivational Video</h4><p>The lack of motivation is one of the most common reasons people have trouble getting in shape. We have trouble making ourselves start. If you are a motivational figure that can inspire others to establish a healthy lifestyle you could be a hit with this type of video. Develop your own way of motivating people, and strive to create a coherent style that fits your own personal philosophy of life.</p><h4 id="9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information"><a href="#9-Meal-Plans-and-Dietary-Information" class="headerlink" title="9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information"></a>9.  Meal Plans and Dietary Information</h4><p>We are what we eat, and in order to stay fit, we must pay attention to everything we take into our system. The vast majority of gym goers don’t really know much about the food they should eat after workouts or how often they should eat. This provides a window of opportunity for you as somebody who does to produce YouTube videos that offer detailed advice on dieting should and regular daily meals for staying healthy and full of energy.</p><h4 id="10-Your-Fitness-Journey"><a href="#10-Your-Fitness-Journey" class="headerlink" title="10.  Your Fitness Journey"></a>10.  Your Fitness Journey</h4><p>Every story has a beginning, so creating a video for your YouTube channel that tells the viewers how your fitness journey began and what you had to go through to get where you are can help you develop a deeper bond with your YouTube followers. You can also document the preparation process for a great challenge, like a triathlon or a marathon, and show your followers what your daily exercise routines look like.</p><h4 id="11-Weight-Loss-Advice"><a href="#11-Weight-Loss-Advice" class="headerlink" title="11.  Weight Loss Advice"></a>11.  Weight Loss Advice</h4><p>For some people, weight can be a major health concern. A few years ago, the American Medical Association has classified obesity as a disease. That’s why YouTube videos that offer advice on how to lose weight in a safe and healthy way, or which provide guidance through the process, can help you build an audience on YouTube.</p><p>Need more video ideas?

It just has to offer enough options to make the process of making a vlog as smooth as it can possibly be. The T7i is not the most powerful DSLR camera out there, but its 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor and a DIGIC 7 image processor are more than enough to meet the needs of most daily vloggers. You can record full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps and use this camera to create HDR and time-lapse movies. You can set the T7i’s ISO up as high as 51200, which is pretty good. The T7i’s dual pixel CMOS AF system makes sure that the camera focuses quickly and it helps you avoid creating video clips that are out focus. There’s also a built-in Wi-FI with an NFC feature that enables you to share your videos with a smartphone device you connect to the camera.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Long battery life</em> <em>- Remarkable image quality at high ISO values</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Can’t record 4K videos</em> <em>- Viewfinder is tiny</em></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-rebel2.png"                      alt="Canon SL2"                ></td><td>Best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS SL2 The Canon EOS SL2 was released just a year ago and it wins our 2018 vote for the best entry-level DSLR camera for vlogging. The SL2 packs a lot of features in a compact camera body. The camera only weighs 1 lb, which is considered light among most DSLR cameras. Many vloggers may enjoy the fact that they can hold up this light camera in front of themselves with more ease. Like a lot of entry-level DSLR cameras, the SL2 comes with an APS-C crop sensor. With ISO capabilities that can reach up to 51200, you’ll be able to film up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps, even under low light conditions. All recent Canon cameras perform very well when it comes to autofocus and the SL2 is no exception. It does, however, have fewer points of focus. The SL2 comes with a 9-point AF system. The SL2 also has a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Microphone jack</em> <em>- Wi-Fi connectivity</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- No 4K video support</em> <em>- Optical image stabilizer could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-80d7.png"                      alt="Canon 80D"                ></td><td>Best mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 80D The Canon EOS 80D is the successor of the 70D which was at one time considered by many YouTubers the ultimate DSLR camera for vlogging. The 80D is a larger camera than the SL2, weighing 1.61 lbs. In its larger build, this camera additionally (compared to the SL2) packs a 45-point AF system, longer battery life, a headphone port, and it is environmentally sealed so you can shoot in tough conditions. This camera’s great performance in autofocusing makes it a great mid-range DSLR camera for vlogging.  <strong>PROS</strong> <em>- Feature-rich</em> <em>- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos</em>   <strong>CONS</strong> <em>- Just one SD card slot</em> <em>- PC sync connection features could be better</em></td></tr><tr><td><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-mark1.png"                      alt="Canon 6D Mark II"                ></td><td>Best professional DSLR camera for vlogging: Canon EOS 6D Mark II There’s a lot of DSLR cameras that come with a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack, but the Canon EOS 6D Mark II is actually the only one in the market that comes equipped with both of those, plus a full-frame sensor. It is its full-frame sensor that really sets this camera apart from the other vlogging DLSR cameras. Because of its full-frame sensor, this camera performs much better in low light conditions. With this larger sensor, you’ll also be able to capture footage that looks more cinematic with high-quality bokeh (more blur to your out-of-focus areas).

Videos are designed to show off what products can do and explain why customers should go on to make a purchase.</p><p>When you have completed your video, you can register for an affiliate marketing program and then add links to your video. The links can be placed either in the video description or as annotations in the clip itself.</p><p>Amazon affiliate marketers don’t always just produce videos – they can also promote products via articles, written reviews and more. To make your marketing program successful, you must ensure people know about your video and encourage them to click on the links and buy the products.</p><p>Though this can seem daunting at first, the more experience you gain, the more revenue you can generate.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project"><a href="#Part-2-Steps-to-start-your-YouTube-affiliate-marketing-project" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project"></a>Part 2: Steps to start your YouTube affiliate marketing project</h2><h3 id="Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship"><a href="#Step-1-build-affiliate-relationship" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: build affiliate relationship"></a>Step 1: build affiliate relationship</h3><p>One of the first steps you should take when getting your project off the ground is to establish relationships with brands that you love. If you do have a genuine love for the product, this should be reflected in the content and encourage others to make purchases.</p><p>Viewers can often tell when your enthusiasm is not genuine, which is why it’s so important to identify products that really do appeal to you. Make a list of the products or programs you use in your daily life and search online to see if there is an affiliate program for it.</p><p>If this is the case, you simply need to apply to join it. You may find that the product, program or service that you love does not have a program. Should this be the situation, contact partners to tell them about your love for the product or service and see if they can set something up. Chances are they will be more than happy to do so, as it could be very beneficial for them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-relationship.JPG"                      alt="affiliate relationship YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Create-your-product-video"><a href="#Step-2-Create-your-product-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Create your product video"></a>Step 2: Create your product video</h3><p>The next step is to actually produce your video. Viewers love honesty, so don’t be afraid to say so if there is a way you feel the product or service could be improved.</p><p>Remember to include calls to action. Un-boxing videos are very popular and show viewers everything inside a package, whilst review videos can also provide valuable insights.</p><p>Top 10 lists also generate high views. You must also remember to include a disclosure that informs viewers that you are being paid via an affiliate marketing scheme. This is a legal obligation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/product-video.JPG"                      alt="product video YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Promote-your-content"><a href="#Step-3-Promote-your-content" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Promote your content"></a>Step 3: Promote your content</h3><p>There are many things you can do to ensure your product is seen. Share your video on all your social media channels, respond to as many questions from viewers as possible and add links to online environments where the product is already being discussed.</p><p>Set up a channel that can be found when relevant search terms are used and make sure your titles are optimized for search too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promote.JPG"                      alt="promote YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Tips-before-you-begin"><a href="#Part-3-3-Tips-before-you-begin" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin"></a>Part 3: 3 Tips before you begin</h2><h3 id="1-Commission-Rate"><a href="#1-Commission-Rate" class="headerlink" title="1. Commission Rate"></a>1. Commission Rate</h3><p>All brands have different commission rates, with some offering up to 50% and others providing around 5%. Make sure you know what the rates are before you proceed and read the terms and conditions carefully. You may well wish to create a dedicated channel or channels to bring everything together. If you’re passionate about other people’s products, it makes perfect sense to get paid to talk about them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comission-rate.JPG"                      alt="comission rate YouTube affiliate marketing"                ></p><h3 id="2-Where-affiliate-links-appear"><a href="#2-Where-affiliate-links-appear" class="headerlink" title="2. Where affiliate links appear"></a>2. Where affiliate links appear</h3><p>Affiliate links are placed below the YouTube video in the description. One issue for YouTube affiliate marketers is that buyers tend to exit YouTube once they have clicked on your link, whether they go on to buy the product or not.</p><p>It is important to try and get as many views as possible to boost exposure for your video, whilst achieving as many sales as you can. Try to strike the ideal balance between encouraging viewers to make a purchase and to watch as much of your content as possible. The more views you receive, the more favorably your content will be treated by YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/affiliate-links.JPG"                      alt="affiliate links"                ></p><h3 id="3-Know-your-product-well"><a href="#3-Know-your-product-well" class="headerlink" title="3. Know your product well"></a>3. Know your product well</h3><p>It is really essential to know your product inside out when you are marketing it to viewers. YouTube viewers expect you to be an expert when it comes to the products you are showcasing, so take as much time as you need to gain an in-depth understanding of how it works and what its features are.</p><p>You must also be able to explain why it makes so much sense to choose the specific product or service over its competitors. Try not to be repetitive, use HD footage and a quality mic, avoid link spamming, choose the best kind of video for the product and plan out the video before you start creating it. Again, engage with your audience as much as you can.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/know-product.JPG"                      alt="know product"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There are various great reasons for getting involved in YouTube affiliate marketing. You may be amazed to see just how much cash you can generate when you follow the above steps and create inspiring videos that showcase products in the best possible light. Just remember to be honest and talk about the cons as well as the pros if they are any. Doing this will help you become a trusted, authentic YouTube affiliate marketer.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others.

Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues.

This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template.

In theory, these recommendations are based on your viewing habits and you’re only directed to videos you’re interested in.</p><p>Except we all know that’s not always what happens.</p><p>YouTube’s recommendations are based on more than just what you’ve watched and searched for, and sometimes even the data on that can get skewed over time. Not all your searches reflect your real tastes, and as your search history builds up the algorithm can start having trouble with all that data.</p><p>Here’s what you can do about it:</p><ol><li><a href="#manage"><strong>Manage Your Watch History</strong></a></li><li><a href="#notinterested"><strong>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</strong></a></li><li><a href="#butwhy"><strong>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Manage-Your-Watch-History"><a href="#Manage-Your-Watch-History" class="headerlink" title="Manage Your Watch History"></a>Manage Your Watch History</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-watch-history.jpg"                      alt="Manage Watch History"                ></p><p>Scroll to the bottom of any page on YouTube and you will see a button marked <strong>History</strong> with an hourglass icon. To access this feature using a mobile device, go to the <strong>Account</strong> tab and tap <strong>History</strong>.</p><p>You will be able to completely clear your watch history, remove specific videos from it, or pause your history while you look at videos you don’t want a record of you visiting. By taking control of your history, you can make sure nothing you looked up on a random whim is reflected in your recommendations.</p><p>If you are being recommended more things you aren’t interested in than things you are, you might want to clear your history completely and start fresh. Maybe your tastes have changed since YouTube started keeping track of them.</p><h2 id="Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested"><a href="#Tell-YouTube-You-Aren’t-Interested" class="headerlink" title="Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested"></a>Tell YouTube You Aren’t Interested</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tell-youtube-not-interested.jpg"                      alt="Tell YouTube Not Interested"                ></p><p>Based on your watch history, YouTube knows what you like. However, they have no way of automatically collecting data on what kinds of videos you’d rather not see.</p><p>What they do have is a system for you to flag recommendations you don’t like.</p><p>Hover over the thumbnail of a video you don’t want to be recommended to you and a small icon that looks like three stacked dots will appear next to the title. Click on that, and then click <strong>Not Interested</strong>.</p><p>When you tell YouTube you aren’t interested in certain videos they use that data to adjust what they recommend for you.</p><h2 id="But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like"><a href="#But-Why-Does-It-Recommend-Stuff-I-Don’t-Like" class="headerlink" title="But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?"></a>But Why Does It Recommend Stuff I Don’t Like?</h2><p>Your search&#x2F;watch history is not the only thing that determines what YouTube recommends for you. Nobody outside of Google knows exactly how the algorithm works, but we do know one of the major factors influencing it is to watch <strong>time</strong>.</p><p>Watch time refers to how a video effects the session time of a viewer. If a video has proven it can keep viewers on YouTube for longer it is more likely to get recommended, even if it isn’t closely related to the interests of individual viewers. The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to keep you on the site longer. Part of that is recommending things, surely, you’ll be interested in, and part of that is trying to get you interested in things that’ll keep you around.</p><p>  A video that is simply watched for longer, because it is engaging and can hold viewers’ attention for a long time, will have a high watch time. So will a video that is short, but which leads into a playlist which holds peoples’ attention. If a video is a frequent session starter – people see it outside of YouTube (i.e. in a Google search) and get to the site through it – then its watch time will be high because it is given credit for all of the time viewers are spending on YouTube watching other videos after they get there.</p><p>The only way to stop certain types of videos from being recommended for you is to take advantage of the ‘not interested’ feature.</p><p> Are you usually happy with YouTube’s recommended videos?</p><h2 id="What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used"><a href="#What-video-editing-software-did-YouTube-suggested-videos-are-used" class="headerlink" title="What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?"></a>What video editing software did YouTube suggested videos are used?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-mobile-music-mayhem-selecting-distorted-apps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mobile Music Mayhem  Selecting Distorted Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/o-money-down-mics-the-frugal-filmmakers-list/"><u>[New] No-Money-Down Mics  The Frugal Filmmaker's List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-paving-the-path-to-online-success-youtubes-keyword-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Paving the Path to Online Success  YouTube's Keyword Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-skyrocket-engagement-optimizing-videos-for-peak-views/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Skyrocket Engagement  Optimizing Videos for Peak Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/levate-your-vlogging-mastering-tripod-angles-and-positions/"><u>[New] Elevate Your Vlogging  Mastering Tripod Angles and Positions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/nfographic-mind-numbing-youtube-factsfigures-and-statistics-for-2024/"><u>[New] Infographic - Mind Numbing YouTube Facts,Figures and Statistics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/bes-twist-rearranging-queue-from-end-to-beginning/"><u>YouTube's Twist  Rearranging Queue From End to Beginning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/unveiling-high-end-picture-sources-at-zero-cost-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling High-End Picture Sources at Zero Cost for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-netflix-location-to-get-more-country-version-on-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Change Netflix Location to Get More Country Version On Apple iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-non-twitter-social-sites/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 5 Non-Twitter Social Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/trouble-with-apple-iphone-7-swipe-up-try-these-11-solutions-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Trouble with Apple iPhone 7 Swipe-Up?

It might be the most important, but it’s not the only important element. The visuals are also essential. There are several reasons why the right DJ template video download can significantly improve your set.</p><p>Read below and you’ll open your eyes to how a simple template and a bit of video editing can change your whole career as a DJ.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgroundss <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="What-Is-a-DJ-Template-Video-Download"><a href="#What-Is-a-DJ-Template-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="What Is a DJ Template Video Download?"></a>What Is a DJ Template Video Download?</h2><p>DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.</p><p>There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-Designed Visuals:</strong> These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.</li><li><strong>Customizable Elements:</strong> You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event’s theme.</li><li><strong>Format and Compatibility:</strong> They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters"><a href="#Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?"></a>Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?</h2><p>Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.</p><p>With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.</p><p>After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.</p><h2 id="Sources-for-DJ-Template-Video-Downloads"><a href="#Sources-for-DJ-Template-Video-Downloads" class="headerlink" title="Sources for DJ Template Video Downloads"></a>Sources for DJ Template Video Downloads</h2><p>So, it’s finally time to look at the best places online where you can find the perfect DJ template video for you.</p><p>Let’s have a quick look at the top five.</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">Motion Elements</a></li><li><a href="#filmora2">Video Hive</a></li><li><a href="#filmora3">Pond5</a></li><li><a href="#filmora4">Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#filmora5">Mixkit</a></li></ul><h3 id="Motion-Elements"><a href="#Motion-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Motion Elements"></a>Motion Elements</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/motion-elements.png"                      alt="motion elements homepage"                ></p><p>Motion Elements has a massive directory of royalty-free elements creators can use.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations"><a href="#Technical-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others.

Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware.
