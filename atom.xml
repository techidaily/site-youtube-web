Here are 15 alternative places where you can get royalty-free music for free! It’ll say at the beginning of every section whether they require attribution or allow commercial use.</p><h2 id="Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download"><a href="#Best-Sites-for-Royalty-Free-Music-for-YouTube-Creators-Free-Download" class="headerlink" title="Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]"></a>Best Sites for Royalty-Free Music for YouTube Creators [Free Download]</h2><p>If you are using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you will find there are some royalty-free music tracks and sound effects already pre-programmed in the Audio library. You will find different styles of music tacks, varying from Young &amp; Bright to Electronic. Download Filmora, and you will get the royalty-free audio library and powerful video editing tools.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><h4 id="1-Audionautix"><a href="#1-Audionautix" class="headerlink" title="1. Audionautix"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://audionautix.com/" >Audionautix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the site with ‘music by audionautix.com’ if you want to use this music (if you have a website, they ask that you include a link back to them).</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No</em>. All of the music on this site is free.</p><p>One of the first things you’ll see when you arrive on Audiionautix is a ‘YouTube Friendly’ button. They know that most people browsing their music library are looking for songs for YouTube videos, and that want you to know their music is safe from copyright claims.</p><p>All of the music in the Audionautix collection was created by one man, Jason Shaw, but there’s still a huge variety of tracks.</p><p>On the front page of Audionautix, there are three selections you can make to start your music search – genre, mood, and tempo. Genres range from hard rock to bluegrass to techno (there are 28 genres in total), and the moods include things like ‘uplifting’, ‘evil’, and ‘bouncy’ (there are 37 of those). The tempos are fast, medium, and slow. So, if you want a medium-tempo acoustic song with a calming mood, you can easily find all of the songs that meet those qualifications.</p><p>Not every combination will deliver results, so it can be easier to just choose two of the three search parameters.</p><h4 id="2-Bensound"><a href="#2-Bensound" class="headerlink" title="2. Bensound"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.bensound.com/" >Bensound <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must include one of the following in your video description: “Music: <a class="link"   href="https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music%E2%80%9D" >https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or “Music: Song title - Bensound.com”</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you don’t want to credit Bensound (or can’t for some reason) then you need to purchase a license. Licensing starts at about $28 USD (price listed as €24) per track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bensound.jpg"                      alt=" Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos -Bensound"                ></p><p>The most popular music from Bensound is displayed on the first page. Beyond the titles of the tracks, each has a short description that will give you a good idea of what to expect from the song before you listen. You’ll need to listen to a song to know if you want it, but the descriptions are a fast way to figure out if you don’t want something. For example, ‘A New Beginning’ could be anything based on that title, but the description lets you know it’s ‘punk rock’ with an ‘epic&#x2F;achievement’ feeling.</p><p>You can narrow down the music you are shown by choosing a genre from the menu near the top of your page (there are 8 genres including cinematic, electronica, and corporate&#x2F;pop). There’s also a search bar, and you can choose whether to display popular or new songs first.</p><p>All of the music on Bensound was created by Benjamin TISSOT, a composer based in France. He has been creating music for over 10 years.</p><h4 id="3-dig-ccMixter"><a href="#3-dig-ccMixter" class="headerlink" title="3. dig.ccMixter"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://dig.ccmixter.org/" >dig.ccMixter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Depends.</em> Some songs are available for commercial use, some are not. It is easy to search only for songs which are.</p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You must credit the musicians.</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can purchase licenses to get around commercial use or attribution restrictions. Personal licenses are $22 USD.</p><p>Musicians upload their work to ccMixter and make it available to creators like you at dig.ccMixter. Over 45,000 musicians have participated and this has resulted in a huge variety of music for you to discover.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ccmixter.JPG"                      alt=" Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos - dig.ccMixter"                ></p><p>Clicking ‘tag search’ at the top of the page is probably the best way to start your search. The ‘tags’ are displayed in three categories – genre, instrument, and style. You can click as many tags as you want from each category (i.e. you can check off ‘classical’ for the genre and then both bass and cello for instruments).</p><p>By default, your search will return results that have even just one of the tags you selected, but you can click ‘match all’ to see results that include all of your selected tags.</p><p>To the right of the screen, there’s a button called ‘filters’ and if you click it it’ll let you narrow your results by license (you can choose to only browse music that is free for commercial use). You can also specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p><p>If you do not use the ‘free for commercial use’ filter then you will need to click on songs to see whether their creative commons licenses allow commercial use.</p><p>If you’re an indie game developer, they have a Music for Video Games section for you too.</p><h4 id="4-Free-Music-Archive"><a href="#4-Free-Music-Archive" class="headerlink" title="4. Free Music Archive"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="http://freemusicarchive.org/" >Free Music Archive <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Depends on the song.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Depends on the song.</em></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em> Everything is free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-music-archive.JPG"                      alt=" Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos - Free Music Archive"                ></p><p>There is a huge selection on Free Music Archive (they include songs curated by other sites, including other sites on this list), but using this site can be a bit trickier than using other sites because there are so many different licenses at play. There are even several licenses that do not allow songs to be used in YouTube videos (any Creative Commons license with ‘ND &#x2F; No Derivatives’ will not allow for use in a video). You should <a class="link"   href="http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not%5FAll%5FMusic%5Fon%5FFMA%5Fis%5FLicensed%5Ffor%5FVideo" >read this page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before downloading anything from the Free Music Archive to use on YouTube.</p><p>To start browsing Free Music Archive for music you can use for your videos, go to ‘Curators’ in the top menu, and select ‘Music for Video’. There’s no point in browsing music you might not be allowed to use for YouTube, and so the site has made it easy to find the music you can.</p><p>By default this screen will not include music you can use commercially, so you need to check ‘allows for commercial use’ in the side menu if that’s important to you. You can also select a genre and specify if you only want instrumental songs.</p><h4 id="5-Free-Stock-Music"><a href="#5-Free-Stock-Music" class="headerlink" title="5. Free Stock Music"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.free-stock-music.com/" >Free Stock Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em> Everything is free.</p><p>Simply choose a genre from the ‘Free Music’ drop-down menu to start browsing Free Stock Music’s collection. There are 10 genres including Pop, Hip Hop, and Corporate.</p><p>There are not a lot of ways to customize your search results on this site. You just can search for a keyword, like ‘happy’, but you can’t narrow your results down by things like instrument or mood like you can on some other sites. You just have to scroll through either your search results or the chosen genre until you find something.</p><p>To make it a bit easier, Free Stock Music has included detailed descriptions of each song you can read while your browsing and these descriptions do tend to include details about instruments and the moods of the songs.</p><p>You need to create a free account on Free Stock Music to access their songs.</p><h4 id="6-Incompetech"><a href="#6-Incompetech" class="headerlink" title="6. Incompetech"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://incompetech.com/music/" >Incompetech <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>YouTube monetization allowed.</em> Other kinds of commercial use may be restricted.</p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> You can put the attribution in your video description.</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you cannot (or do not want to) credit Incompetech then you can purchase a license instead. Licensing 1 piece of music costs $30.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/incompetech.JPG"                      alt=" Royalty Free Music Sites For YouTube Videos - Incompetech"                ></p><p>Incompetech allows you to browse one of three ways. The ‘Full Search’ will be best for most people, but if you want to see every song in alphabetical order you can click on ‘Full List’, or you can browse collections like ‘Comedic’ in ‘View Collections’ (but not every piece of music on the site can be found in a collection).</p><p>If you go into ‘Full Search’ you’ll see a list of all the music and be able to filter it by feel, tempo, genre, and length. For example, you could set ‘Feels’ to ‘Grooving’ or ‘Length’ to ‘3:00-3:29’.</p><p>You can also use the search bar to look for an instrument or song title.</p><p>Clicking Expand All will reveal descriptions of all the songs and a ‘listen now’ button, but it will stretch the page a lot. You can see more details about individual songs, and listen to them, by clicking on the title. You won’t be taken to a new page, which is convenient.</p><p>You can also download all the music at once (by clicking ‘download all the music on this site at once’).</p><h4 id="7-Josh-Woodward"><a href="#7-Josh-Woodward" class="headerlink" title="7.

Free download: <a class="link"   href="http://joshwoodward.com/" >http://joshwoodward.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> If you cannot give Josh credit for some reason you can buy a single-song license for $30.</p><p>Josh Woodward is a singer-songwriter who has chosen to allow the free use of all his music (although he does appreciate donations).</p><p>You’ll immediately see a list of music on Josh’s site (not everything, there are over 200 songs on this site), and you can change what is displayed by using the filters on the right of the page. The filters available are Playlist, Genre, Album, Tags, Tempo, and Length.</p><p>The playlists are songs that have been bundled together around a theme like ‘fun and fast’ or ‘popular in videos’.</p><p>There are nine genres to choose from including ‘dark acoustic’ and ‘Americana’.</p><p>The albums are albums that Josh has released.</p><p>You can also search the song titles and lyrics by typing keywords into the search bar.</p><p>At the top of the page, there’s a player you can use to preview the songs, and you can choose whether to browse vocal songs or songs with lyrics (the results below may not appear to change, but if you use the player you’ll hear the instrumental version instead of the version with vocals).</p><h4 id="8-Looperman"><a href="#8-Looperman" class="headerlink" title="8. Looperman"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://www.looperman.com/" >Looperman <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Allowed for loops, but they make no guarantees.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Unclear.</em> The site doesn’t address attribution so it may be up to whoever has uploaded the loop you want to use.</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p>Looperman is a community for musicians. The goal is to provide instrumental loops and acapella vocals to other musicians for their own projects. In theory, all of the music loops and sounds are completely free to use in your projects, but since it’s a community they cannot guarantee that a user hasn’t uploaded something they don’t own (they aren’t allowed to, so in theory you should be safe, but the site doesn’t make any guarantees).</p><p>If you want to use vocals it seems like you have to talk to the person who owns the vocals about whether you can use them commercially or whether you need to include attribution.</p><h4 id="9-Moby-Gratis"><a href="#9-Moby-Gratis" class="headerlink" title="9. Moby Gratis"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="http://www.mobygratis.com/" >Moby Gratis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Never allowed.</em> You cannot make money from the project you use this music in any way, including YouTube monetization or through a service like Patreon.</p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Yes.</em> Put this in your video description: Music: [Track Name] by Moby courtesy of Mobygratis.com</p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p>Moby is a Grammy-nominated, VMA-winning, artist whose work you have probably heard on the radio. Even if you aren’t familiar with Moby himself, he has co-written, produced, and remixed music for other major artists like David Bowie, Guns N’ Roses, and Daft Punk.</p><p>Moby has chosen to make a catalog of his work available to independent filmmakers for non-commercial projects. Not all of the music provided on the site is available for YouTube, only the music marked Unreleased (if it has been released, then it will be flagged by YouTube’s copyright system). There is a lot of music under the ‘Unreleased’ category, though.</p><p>In order to download songs, you will need to make an account, and it takes about 24 hours for your account to be approved.</p><h4 id="10-Musopen"><a href="#10-Musopen" class="headerlink" title="10. Musopen"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://musopen.org/" >Musopen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Commercial Use?</strong> <em>Depends on the song.</em></p><p><strong>Attribution Required?</strong> <em>Depends on the song</em></p><p><strong>Paid Options?</strong> <em>No.</em></p><p>Musopen provides music that is either in the ‘public domain’, or protected by Creative Commons licenses. If it’s in the public domain that means that nobody owns the copyright and anyone can use it for anything (however, Musopen does warn that they do not review uploads from their users so it is possible that someone could upload something they claim is public domain and be lying or wrong).</p><p>Creative Commons licenses all have their own conditions. Some may block commercial use, some may require attribution. The ones you need to watch out for as a video creator are the ones marked ‘No Derivatives’, because you can’t use songs licensed this way in videos.</p><p>You can start using Musopen by typing a keyword into the search bar on the main page, or scrolling down to select ‘Browse royalty free music recordings’. Besides music recordings, Musopen provides sheet music. If you have some musical talent and want to record your own music for your videos then this might be useful. If not, you probably want to stick to the recordings.</p><p>If you click on the Music Discovery Tool you’ll be able to search the recordings not only by instrument, but by license (so you can make sure you’re only looking at music that is in the public domain, or make sure you’re not looking at anything with that ‘No Derivatives’ condition.</p><h4 id="11-TeknoAXE"><a href="#11-TeknoAXE" class="headerlink" title="11.

There are several sub-categories under every category.</p><p>Once you’ve clicked into subcategory you’ll see thumbnails for every song in the category. Click on one to be taken to the song’s page, where you can listen to it before you decide if you want to download.</p><p>There are tons of places where you can find great royalty-free music you can use on YouTube, so start hunting! Finding the perfect song for that cool montage you’ve got planned, your intro sequence, or the background of your vlog will take your content to a new level of quality.</p><h4 id="12-PacDV"><a href="#12-PacDV" class="headerlink" title="12.

There is no way to filter down the music, and there is no search function.</p><p>There is a column in the list of music for ‘moods&#x2F;emotions’, so you can get an idea of which songs you might want to listen to before you click to their pages.</p><h4 id="13-Partners-In-Rhyme"><a href="#13-Partners-In-Rhyme" class="headerlink" title="13.

At $100 or more per song, their paid music is outside the budget of most YouTubers.</p><p>Partners In Rhyme is mostly a paid site, and they’re at the pricier end of the spectrum for paid sites. The reason they’re included on this list is that they have kindly curated a selection of free music for use on YouTube or in projects like podcasts (the link above will take you to the free page, not the site in general).</p><p>There isn’t a search function for the free music, or a way to narrow down what’s displayed, but you can click the play button next to any title to hear what the song sounds like. To download, just right click and choose ‘save file’ or ‘save target as’.</p><h4 id="14-Purple-Planet-Music"><a href="#14-Purple-Planet-Music" class="headerlink" title="14.

The categories are more related to moods than genres and include things like ‘cute’, ‘sneaky’, and ‘reflective’. Because they know you may want to use this music in film projects, you can even find categories like ‘dark backgrounds’.</p><p>Once you click into a category everything is listed, you can’t narrow your results. There’s not an overwhelming number of songs in each category, though, so it’s easy to choose something just by reading descriptions and listening to what’s there.</p><h4 id="15-Sounds-Crate"><a href="#15-Sounds-Crate" class="headerlink" title="15.

It’s all about flexing your creativity muscle and we are here to help you do it. Are you ready to be inspired? Great! Let’s begin this list:</p><h2 id="2-Showcase-Who-You-Are"><a href="#2-Showcase-Who-You-Are" class="headerlink" title="2. Showcase Who You Are"></a><strong>2. Showcase Who You Are</strong></h2><p><strong>Talk About Yourself:</strong> Introduce yourself to the world. You can answer 10 of the most common ice breaker questions you get at social gatherings: “Who are you?” “What do you do for a living?” “What are your hobbies?” In this video, you get to decide how you want to showcase yourself to your audience.</p><p><strong>Reviews:</strong> Do you have opinions? Of course, you do. Movie trailers, popular YouTube videos, products such as makeup, gadgets, and toys, you have thoughts on everything. It’s more than content creation, it’s critical thinking. Understanding why you like or dislike something is not only helpful for other people like you, but it’s also helpful for you to know your own preferences. It’s a little exercise in self-discovery.</p><p><strong>Day in a Life:</strong> Bring the audience with you on a day of your life. Show people what it is like to walk in your shoes from morning to night. How do you commute to school or work? What do you have for lunch? What obstacles do you encounter throughout the day? You’ll be surprised what will happen as your day unfolds.</p><p><strong>Top 10:</strong> People love lists because it’s a simple rundown. When you set your video as a list, the viewer knows exactly what they are getting, and familiarity with the format will make it more likely to be clicked. While you can make a top 12 or top 16 list, it is shown that picking <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3024538/why-we-love-top-10-lists" >a number ending on “0” will yield the best results <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Routines:</strong> What do you do when you get ready for school or work? What do you do before bed? Discussing your routine can inspire people to lead the life you have. <a class="link"   href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/brianna-wiest/2015/10/the-psychology-of-daily-routine-7-reasons-why-people-who-do-the-same-things-each-day-tend-to-be-happier-than-those-who-chase-adventure/" >A routine does not mean going to an office every day <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it can mean eating a new restaurant every month, doing something impulsive once a week, or appreciating what you have on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> You’ve come a long way and you don’t always acknowledge it. Were there a few pivotal milestones in the last five years? Were there new friends you made or new places you’ve been to? Can’t think of anything? Well, pull out your calendar and flip back a few months and a few years. Was there something you scheduled that you’ve forgotten? It was important enough for you to mark it down at the time, reflect on how it went, and what you got out of it.</p><p> <strong>Favorites: Game, food, or sports team: when you talk about your favorite things, you allow people to take a peek into the history of you. It’s easier to get people excited when you talk about something you are passionate about, so do it! Also, talking about your favorite thing allow other people who like those things to find you. This is a great way to find and build your own community</strong></p><p><strong>Relatonships:</strong> Your parents, your partner, your teachers, or your friends, your relationship with each of those people are different, even though you are the same person. That’s the beauty of a relationship. This makes it a great topic to share on YouTube because it shows a unique side of who you are every time you speak about another relationship you have.</p><p> <strong>Rant:</strong> The world is out to get you… not really, but there are enough annoying situations during the week to fill a weekly rant segment for your channel. Here’s a tip about ranting that you should use to avoid sounding whiny: offer a solution at the end or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uEDTM2g3WQ%20" >be funny <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Show and Tell:</strong> Like the elementary school exercise, show and tell is a terrific way to show off something interesting you have and talk about the significance of it. An old childhood toy, a new gadget, a gift from a friend: every item has a story, show and tell it.</p><h2 id="3-Challenge-Yourself"><a href="#3-Challenge-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="3. Challenge Yourself"></a><strong>3. Challenge Yourself</strong></h2><p><strong>Leave Your Comfort Zone:</strong> Do something that you didn’t think you can do and film it. It might end up being a <a href="#Fail">Fail</a>, but that is how you learn. Learn a new language and talk to a native speaker. Go bungee jumping. Offer free hugs in public. Do something that makes your heart beat faster everyday and film it.</p><p><strong>Live On A Budget:</strong> Reduce your weekly budget to $50, can you do it? How about $10? This YouTube video idea gives you perspective into your life. How will your lifestyle change when you vastly reduce your expenses? Knowing this can actually help us prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p><p> <strong>30 Day Challenge:</strong> Usually a 30-day challenge is associated with partaking in a healthy activity such as exercise or giving up a bad habit. But all that has been done, why not challenge yourself to do something different? Cook all your meals for 30 days. Take a different route to work every day for 30 days. Have a 10-minute long conversation with someone new for 30 days.</p><p><strong>Speed Round:</strong> You think you are good at something? Well, why not try to do it as quickly as possible? Complete a round of video games as quickly as you can. Do a MasterChef mystery box challenge in your kitchen. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E" >Run from one subway station to the next <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, beating the tube itself.</p><h2 id="4-Show-Your-Talent"><a href="#4-Show-Your-Talent" class="headerlink" title="4. Show Your Talent"></a><strong>4. Show Your Talent</strong></h2><p><strong>Make Music:</strong> An original song, a cover, or a remix, YouTube is a fantastic platform to showcase your musical talents. Don’t forget, some of the world’s top artists began their journey on YouTube. You might be next to join the <a class="link"   href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/best-artists-discovered-on-youtube" >discovered on YouTube list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Creating:</strong> Are you an artist? Show your process in making a piece. Depending on the speed in which your project takes, use a timelapse to present what you did in the most effective way.</p><p> <strong>Unusual skill:</strong> Do you have a party trick that you would love to show everyone, but don’t have a party to go to? YouTube is the place for you. Juggle, do a magic trick, dance like Christopher Walkens, whatever unusual skill you have, share it on camera, and get the accolades you so deserve.</p><h2 id="5-Explore-Your-Surroundings"><a href="#5-Explore-Your-Surroundings" class="headerlink" title="5. Explore Your Surroundings"></a><strong>5. Explore Your Surroundings</strong></h2><p><strong>Tour:</strong> Your home, your office, your city. Bring your camera and take your audience on a tour of a place you know well. Show them all the hidden gems, tell them a story about the history, and be spontaneous and discover along the way.</p><p> <strong>Special Event:</strong> In any community, there is always a special event taking place, whether it be a concert, a festival, or a conference. Film the environment, interview attendees, and share the experience.</p><p><strong>Travel:</strong> Go on a trip and bring your camera with you. Create drama by documenting all the things that didn’t go as planned… and any memorable trip will have hiccups along the way. Discover things along the way and vocalize your thoughts through the trip.</p><p><strong>Discuss Current Events:</strong> As the environmental climate, there is also a social and political climate. Address the current state of events in your city. Are there plans to build new infrastructure? Is there a social injustice that the public should know about? You can discuss international affairs, national politics, or keep it local to start.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Be-An-Educator"><a href="#6-Be-An-Educator" class="headerlink" title="6. Be An Educator"></a><strong>6. Be An Educator</strong></h2><p><strong>Advice:</strong> Have you been through a trying experience? Do you have advice for other people setting off on the same path? Whether it’s graduating school, starting a new job, losing weight, or practicing a new skill, creating content that offers helpful advice for those seeking it will give you credibility to speak about the topic since you have gone through the situation yourself.</p><p><strong>How to Plan Something:</strong> Did you plan a camping trip that went really well? Did you throw a surprise birthday party that went without a hitch? It doesn’t have to be anything grand but think back to something you followed successfully and explain what you did to achieve it.</p><p> <strong>Lifehacks:</strong> Do you have lifehacks? This may be the most generous gift you can share with your audience. You can save them time, energy, and a whole lot of headaches. If you have an engineering spirit, then consider how you can simplify all the little activities that make up a day. No engineering spirit? Start with these <a class="link"   href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/100-life-hacks-that-make-life-easier.html" >lifehacks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>instead.</p><p><strong>Time Management:</strong> The responsibility of every person is slightly different, but how you manage your daily schedule. Do you write tasks down on an agenda? Do you have a calendar? What do you do when you get distracted? What is your schedule like? Do you create your own bullet journal or use a productivity app? If so, share it!</p><p> <strong>Guided Activities:</strong> For beginners, some activities are better with a guide. If the audience is unable to join an in-person class, YouTube is a wonderful online alternative for guided activities such as yoga, meditation, and other exercise or relaxation activities.</p><p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> Is there software you use particularly well? Are you skilled in the kitchen or the garage? Can you install appliances without reading the instructions? Give a step-by-step tutorial in completing a project.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098704/14409" target="_top" id="2098704">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098704" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098704/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle"><a href="#7-Share-Your-Beliefs-and-Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle"></a><strong>7. Share Your Beliefs and Lifestyle</strong></h2><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Whatever you are pursuing, know that there are many on the same path as you. If you are an aspiring dancer create content for those that are with you on the journey. Encourage them and speak authentically about the accomplishments to come. Motivation is the energy that is in circulation. The more you send out into the universe, the more will come back to you.</p><p><strong>Pets:</strong> If you share your home with animals, then you have no shortage of content. Point the camera at your dogs, cats, and ferrets for a while and see what ridiculous scenarios they get up to.</p><p><strong>Fitness and Food:</strong> Do you subscribe to a specific type of fitness and diet? Have you seen the results that you want to share? Yes, perfect! If no, then why not do a little experimentation. Try to include a fitness and diet regimen in your daily life and vlog about it. Who knows, it might become a healthy change.</p><p><strong>Tattoos, Piercing, or Scars:</strong> Every tattoo, piercing, and a scar on your body probably have an interesting story behind it. Whether it is something you are proud of or something you may prefer to hide, recognizing the different marks on your body and how they represent your history is a great way to reflect and get inspired.</p><p><strong>Document Your Journey:</strong> It’s important to set achievable goals for yourself. That’s how you can encourage progress within yourself. With a goal and a timeline in mind, it can be as simple as documenting your journey towards it. If you are working on your novel, you can do a vlog updating the viewers on your process and word count or even bringing a camera with you as your piece gets workshopped.</p><p><strong>Holiday:</strong> We all share memories of that wonderful time of year. For some it’s a spectacle for others it’s a modest affair. How do you celebrate the holidays and is there a story to that tradition?</p><p><strong>Career:</strong> So much of our identity is related to what we do for a living. Talking about your day job on YouTube can be tricky. Be authentic, but also use your discretion, because you don’t want to misrepresent yourself professionally to the world.</p><p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> What is your relationship with money, weekends, and your extended family? Thinking about your values can help you explore life philosophically, thus encouraging you to live the best life possible. As you speak about your philosophy, you are bound to experience alternative views, and that is where great content materializes.</p><p><strong>Haul:</strong> If you have some money to spend, create a haul YouTube video. Haul video involves you going on a shopping spree and bringing home a big “haul.” In essence, it is an unboxing video on steroids. This type of video generally involves fashion or groceries, but it can be related to anything in large quantity. It’s all about showing off your new stuff to the audience.</p><p><strong>Unboxing:</strong> Got something new from Amazon? Before you open it, turn on your camera. Unboxing is an easy YouTube video idea that allows your viewers who are considering buying the item to better understand whether it is in fact the right purchase for them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975816/19272" target="_top" id="1975816">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975816" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975816/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity"><a href="#8-Nurture-Your-Curiosity" class="headerlink" title="8. Nurture Your Curiosity"></a><strong>8. Nurture Your Curiosity</strong></h2><p><strong>Build Something:</strong> IKEA furniture, a website, a LEGO miniature, a business plan. The best way to get better at something is to just do it. Use your hands and build something and capture it for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Behind the Scenes:</strong> It’s not only the entertainment industry that offers behind the scenes content, but many businesses offer tours and open houses. Reach out to any business or organization you are curious about the inner workings and odds are there will be a day where you can pop in and have a look at what it makes the wheels turn.</p><p><strong>Jargon and Slang:</strong> From fashion to baseball to dentistry, everything has its own set of jargon or slang. What’s a galloon? What does it mean to win the pennant? What is 3MOD? If you are interested in languages, then diving into the world of jargon and slang is an interesting one.</p><p><strong>Deconstruct a Process:</strong> Be like Tim Ferriss by breaking down a process into parts enabling you to learn a new skill faster, whether it be language or sports or <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNtrp0M-qs4" >coffee <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Show your viewer how to properly learn how to improve performance by simplifying.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> We all want to learn a new language, but it isn’t easy. If you have a knack for languages, show it off as a skill. Help new speakers avoid common mistakes, discuss the etymology of each word, and explore all the diverse dialects.</p><p><strong>Accents:</strong> How accents derive is a fascinating topic to explore if you are seeking good ideas for YouTube. Why do some accents sound like music while other sound abrasive? Why different neighborhoods in the same city have different accents? There are endless questions to explore. Even<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa6cHEJIjYI" >constructed languages can be analyzed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their accents.</p><p><strong>History:</strong> Are you interested in your city, your school, or the land your office is built upon? What was it like ten years ago? A hundred years ago? An exploration of history does not have to be about Rome or Mesopotamia, it can be about your backyard<br><strong>Debunking Myths:</strong> Before every MythBusters episode they warn you not to attempt any of their experiments, and we are not encouraging you to either. At least, not to their scale. There is a multitude of myths out there that can use your expert eye to explore. In your city itself, there are stories worth debunking or at least learning more about.</p><p><strong>Compare Two Things:</strong> Need something to do on YouTube? Why not compare diets such as Paleo vs Keto, devices such as Android vs iPhone, or a remake vs an original?</p><p><strong>Opposing Opinions:</strong> Do you have a friend who always has to argue with you about everything: films, values, politics? Well, don’t just save those conversations for private, invite him or her over and film a debate.</p><p><strong>Deep Dive:</strong> Go down the rabbit hole on a topic you are really fascinated about. Dissect every song from an artist, read every book by an author, or learn about a different type of plant growing in your community. Everywhere you look, you should see opportunities to get obsessed over a topic.</p><p><strong>Biography of Someone:</strong> It could be a famous person or it can be someone from your family. Tell their story in a way that only you can. Get interviews, do research, and find a personal connection. Every life is significant, now it is your chance to honor that.</p><p><strong>Fun Facts:</strong> Grab a deck of questions from Trivial Pursuit and pick a fun fact to explore. Use it as a jumping-off point for exploring an interesting topic. Share it with viewers who might not have known that they were interested in this fact.</p><p><strong>Timeline of a Topic:</strong> Pick any topic and trace the lineage and better understand how it has gotten to this point. Where did it begin, has it hit critical mass, and how has it evolved over the years?</p><h2 id="9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic"><a href="#9-Be-a-Fan-and-a-Critic" class="headerlink" title="9. Be a Fan and a Critic"></a><strong>9.

Use their existing storyline to guide where you toward an interesting YouTube video about how they could have evolved.</p><p><strong>Re-edit:</strong> Use your editing skills to recreate a classic movie scene, allowing it to have a completely different tone. Or mashup footage from a variety of sources to create an original piece of video content.  </p><p><strong>Speculation of Unreleased Entertainment:</strong> There are always rumors of upcoming movies, music, and books from famous filmmakers, musicians, and authors. Speculate on what the new release can possibly be about. Generate buzz and excitement and consider what you would do if you were put into the shoes of those famous creators.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on the Best</strong>: In every field, there are those that are considered world-class. How did they get there, what support did they get, and how are they working to stay at the top? Highlight their achievements and see what we can anticipate from them in the future.</p><p><strong>Commentary:</strong> Can you offer insights into a particular piece of work? Share it with the world and add another dimension to what the viewers have already seen.</p><p><strong>Spotlight on Something Not So Popular:</strong> Is there something you adore that nobody really knows about? You can be the one to help this become mainstream.</p><p><strong>Tribute:</strong> Pay tribute to a personality or an event from the past. Help people remember the significance of what happened from the past through your YouTube video.</p><p><strong>Shoutout:</strong> Like sending out a thank you card, use YouTube to publicly thank someone for doing something awesome! It’s like you are giving a toast to someone in front of the whole Internet, what an honor.</p><p><strong>Summarize a Book, Movie, or TV Show:</strong> Give the Coles note summary of a book, a movie, or TV show. Challenge yourself to make a summary that is as interesting as the actual source material.</p><p><strong>“Best of” Video:</strong> Select the best scenes from your favorite actor or the best plays from your favorite athlete and compile it into a video that highlights all the best moments.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="10-Create-Entertainment"><a href="#10-Create-Entertainment" class="headerlink" title="10.

If you parody something trending, it can help you catch the wave of popularity and bring in views as all eyes are currently on that topic.</p><p><strong>Break Something:</strong> There is nothing like watching something get destroyed. Maybe that’s why the Will it Blend videos got so popular. No matter how we resist it, we enjoy seeing the destruction.</p><p><strong>Time Lapse:</strong> The growth of a plant, the flow of traffic, the rise and fall of the sun through your eyes. In this fast pace world, it’s fun to see organized chaos at a rapid rate.</p><p><strong>Screen Sharing:</strong> Let people watch you play a video game or give a tour of your desktop.

Tell a great story about your life or your city with great moving images.</p><p><strong>Short subject documentary:</strong> Pick a topic that matters and explore in through the structure of a documentary.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Tackle-Missing-Thumbnails-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#How-to-Tackle-Missing-Thumbnails-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="How to Tackle Missing Thumbnails on YouTube Shorts"></a>How to Tackle Missing Thumbnails on YouTube Shorts</h2><p>Video thumbnails are important since they encourage people to click and watch the video. But what if your set <strong>YouTube Shorts thumbnail is not showing</strong>? YouTube will use a random part of the video as the thumbnail. It may be an unflattering or uninteresting shot. Then, your Shorts video is doomed.</p><p>That said, it is a problem you want to solve. Here are 7 FAQs about YouTube Shorts thumbnails. They may help you with fixing this issue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.gif"                      alt="youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q1-Can-I-Customize-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q1. Can I Customize YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Yes, you can. YouTube did allow short-form video creators to upload custom thumbnails for their Shorts. However, they aren’t that optimized. For instance, some people may not see them on the Shorts shelf. Also, if you share a link to the video somewhere else, the old video thumbnail may show instead of the new one.</p><p>Adding a custom thumbnail for YouTube Shorts is the same as adding one for long-form videos on the platform. Follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Open the YouTube mobile app. Click the “Plus” icon at the bottom center &gt; “Create Short.” Upload, edit, and post your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-1.jpg"                      alt="creating shorts on youtube app"                ></p><ul><li>Get to your desktop computer or laptop. Open your channel’s YouTube Studio.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-2.JPG"                      alt="opening youtube studio on computer"                ></p><ul><li>On the left navigation menu, click “Content.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-3.JPG"                      alt="content section on youtube studio"                ></p><ul><li>Click the “pencil” icon next to the Shorts you just uploaded. This video should be at the top of the list.</li><li>Navigate to the Thumbnail section. Click “Create Thumbnail.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-change-thumbnail-5.JPG"                      alt="changing shorts thumbnail on youtube studio"                ></p><h2 id="Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing"><a href="#Q2-Why-Are-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails-Not-Showing" class="headerlink" title="Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?"></a>Q2. Why Are YouTube Shorts Thumbnails Not Showing?</h2><p>It’s not you who’s the only one with Shorts thumbnails not showing. Many short-form content creators on the platform are also facing this issue. A YouTuber took to Reddit to complain about how he uploaded custom thumbnails for all his videos. The thumbnails are correct in the editor. However, YouTube still displays a random frame as the thumbnail on the Shorts shelf.</p><p><em>“They ALL have randomly selected different parts of each video I have uploaded &amp; somehow generated a new&#x2F;unknown thumbnail that was neither what I uploaded as the custom option nor 1 of the 3 that YouTube auto populated.”</em></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/v51d93/youtube%5Fshorts%5Fthumbnails%5Fnot%5Fappearing%5Fcorrectly/" >YouTuber on Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The reason behind this is the difference in the thumbnail size. Regular YouTube video thumbnails are in the ratio of 16:9. Meanwhile, Shorts uses a ratio of 9:16. The thing is that YouTube does not yet allow you to upload 9:16 thumbnails. Thus, the thumbnail for Shorts may show correctly on the video section but not on the Shorts shelf.</p><h2 id="Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem"><a href="#Q3-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnail-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?"></a>Q3. How to Fix YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problem?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fix-youtube-shorts-thumbnail-not-showing.JPG"                      alt="fix youtube shorts thumbnail not showing problem"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, there is no reliable fix to this problem yet. YouTubers have tried different things in hopes that YouTube will display the correct thumbnail for their Shorts.</p><p>Some YouTubers have tried using different images. Others have experimented with changing the aspect ratio of the thumbnail or using Adobe editor for ratios. Clearing histories and cache, using different browsers, resizing, and changing the images’ resolution have also been done. Sadly, these are all failed attempts.</p><h2 id="Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails"><a href="#Q4-How-To-Boost-Views-When-I-Have-no-Control-Over-YouTube-Shorts-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?"></a>Q4. How To Boost Views When I Have no Control Over YouTube Shorts Thumbnails?</h2><p>Attracting viewers on Shorts is the same as attracting viewers on the main YouTube. You use interesting thumbnails and video titles. Since thumbnails are out of the options, selecting great video titles has become even more important.</p><p>Here are some pointers. Your title should be at most 40 characters. Also, it should be concise and irresistible. And forget about SEO since no one is searching for YouTube Shorts anyway. People consume what they see in their feeds. So instead, the title should be “snappy.” It should intrigue, entertain, or enlighten the viewers. That will net you some views for your Shorts content.</p><h2 id="Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts"><a href="#Q5-How-To-Get-More-Views-on-YouTube-Shorts" class="headerlink" title="Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?"></a>Q5. How To Get More Views on YouTube Shorts?</h2><p>Forgoing the intro is the way to go. An intro will just prolong the video when people are in Shorts to find bite-sized videos. So jump right into the video content. You can also start the video with a still frame instead. Using hashtags, captions, and text effects are also recommended. And interacting with your audience through comments and pinned comments will keep them coming back to your Shorts channel.</p><p>Of course, ensuring that the video quality is high is key to getting more views. For that, you need a good video editor. You can try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a powerful and easy-to-use video editor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shorts-thumbnail-faqs-filmora.JPG"                      alt="filmora mobile feature showcase"                ></p><p>The best thing is that you don’t need to transfer the video from your phone to your computer and back. Wondershare Filmora is available on mobile. And it’s one of the best tools for enhancing a short-form video.</p><p>Short-form video watchers love filters, transitions, and effects. And Filmora gives you access to all of that. It provides you with fun and amazing filters, effects, transitions, and stamps that can add a wow factor to your short-form video.</p><h2 id="Q6-Do-YouTube-Shorts-Make-Money"><a href="#Q6-Do-YouTube-Shorts-Make-Money" class="headerlink" title="Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?"></a>Q6. Do YouTube Shorts Make Money?</h2><p>Making money from YouTube Shorts was challenging. The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP.

The platform pays content creators who are doing well through the Creator Fund. However, as Shorts grew, the payout became smaller.</p><p>Luckily, that’s going to change. Starting this year, Shorts will be a part of the YouTube Partner Program. This means that you can make money from the ads that people watch on Shorts. According to YouTube, creators will keep 45% of the revenue. It will be distributed based on your share of total Shorts views.</p><p>YouTube also adjusted the requirements to qualify for the YPP.

It might be the most important, but it’s not the only important element. The visuals are also essential. There are several reasons why the right DJ template video download can significantly improve your set.</p><p>Read below and you’ll open your eyes to how a simple template and a bit of video editing can change your whole career as a DJ.</p><p><strong>YouTube Video Background</strong> Creating realistic video scenes at your will is easy to complete with Filmora green screen removal.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgrounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Create Video Backgroundss <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn Green Screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Is-a-DJ-Template-Video-Download"><a href="#What-Is-a-DJ-Template-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="What Is a DJ Template Video Download?"></a>What Is a DJ Template Video Download?</h2><p>DJ template video downloads are basically video templates with pre-recorded clips and effect presets that sync with your music. So, regardless of what tempo, genre, or style your DJ set is, this template will sync with it perfectly and make everything look more professional, modern, funky, or whatever result you prefer.</p><p>There are three main characteristics of DJ template videos, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Pre-Designed Visuals:</strong> These templates are ready-made visuals that can be used as-is or customized further. They range from abstract patterns and pulsating geometries to thematic scenes and rhythmic animations.</li><li><strong>Customizable Elements:</strong> You can personally customize many of these templates. This might include integrating logos and text or tweaking the color scheme to match the event’s theme.</li><li><strong>Format and Compatibility:</strong> They are usually available in formats compatible with common VJing and DJing software, ensuring seamless integration into the DJ’s setup.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters"><a href="#Why-Choosing-the-Right-Template-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?"></a>Why Choosing the Right Template Matters?</h2><p>Every DJ out there has their own unique style. This can be displayed by the music they play, the events they attend, the style of clothing they wear, and so on. Well, the same style can be represented by their videos as well.</p><p>With that said, it’s crucial that you make your video in such a way that your style is kept and immediately recognized by your fans. That can easily be achieved with a background template video for your set.</p><p>After all, your goal is to create an unforgettable experience that truly impresses everyone. You can do the same for live events as well as for your pre-recorded DJ sets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043618/7443" target="_top" id="2043618">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043618" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043618/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sources-for-DJ-Template-Video-Downloads"><a href="#Sources-for-DJ-Template-Video-Downloads" class="headerlink" title="Sources for DJ Template Video Downloads"></a>Sources for DJ Template Video Downloads</h2><p>So, it’s finally time to look at the best places online where you can find the perfect DJ template video for you.</p><p>Let’s have a quick look at the top five.</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">Motion Elements</a></li><li><a href="#filmora2">Video Hive</a></li><li><a href="#filmora3">Pond5</a></li><li><a href="#filmora4">Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#filmora5">Mixkit</a></li></ul><h3 id="Motion-Elements"><a href="#Motion-Elements" class="headerlink" title="Motion Elements"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.motionelements.com/" >Motion Elements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/motion-elements.png"                      alt="motion elements homepage"                ></p><p>Motion Elements has a massive directory of royalty-free elements creators can use.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations"><a href="#Technical-Considerations" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123749/7443" target="_top" id="2123749">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123749" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123749/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

However, not all templates are customizable.</p><p>In order for a template to be customizable, it has to be available in a format for tools such as Premiere Pro, Filmora, or many others. If it isn’t, then you are very limited with the editing if it’s an MP4 file, for example.</p><p>This is why using a DJ template video background on a full screen directly from a video editing tool like Filmora is the easiest solution for editing it. Any template you click from the tool will be fully editable, adjustable, and customizable.</p><p>You can control its colors, speed, animations, and so on.</p><h2 id="Technical-Considerations-1"><a href="#Technical-Considerations-1" class="headerlink" title="Technical Considerations"></a>Technical Considerations</h2><p>Now, if you want the best possible results with your video templates, you must put technical considerations into account. It’s not the most fun process but it is crucial. Luckily, this guide will make it easier.</p><p>So, consider the following:</p><h5 id="1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1"><a href="#1-Video-Resolution-and-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Resolution and Quality"></a>1. Video Resolution and Quality</h5><p>Try to find high-definition or 4K templates. They will give the best visuals and be more flexible in editing or customization.</p><p>Also, choose templates that match your display setup’s aspect ratio, whether standard (16:9) or widescreen formats.</p><h5 id="2-Format-Compatibility-1"><a href="#2-Format-Compatibility-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Format Compatibility"></a>2. Format Compatibility</h5><p>Common video formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV are widely supported by most DJ software and hardware. Ensure the template format is compatible with your equipment.</p><p>Additionally, think about the video codec you are using. Some codecs might not be supported by your playback system, or they might be too resource-intensive.</p><h5 id="3-Performance-and-Playback-1"><a href="#3-Performance-and-Playback-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Performance and Playback"></a>3. Performance and Playback</h5><p>The frame rate of the video should match that of your DJ software to avoid any sync issues. Common frame rates include 30fps and 60fps.</p><p>If your set is fairly long, make sure you’ve set the video template to loop seamlessly if you don’t want to look unprofessional.</p><h5 id="4-Audio-Sync-1"><a href="#4-Audio-Sync-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Audio Sync"></a>4. Audio Sync</h5><p>Some templates are designed to sync with the beat of the music. Check if the template has features that allow easy synchronization with your tracks.</p><p>You might also want to consider reactive templates. These are templates that change with the music and can add an engaging dynamic element to your performance.</p><h2 id="Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1"><a href="#Legal-Aspects-and-Copyright-1" class="headerlink" title="Legal Aspects and Copyright"></a>Legal Aspects and Copyright</h2><p>This part concerns most of us when using creative elements like these. So, it’s always a good idea to read the licenses and agreements before using anything.</p><p>Here are a couple of things you should always keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Always read the licensing agreement of a template before using it. This agreement specifies how you can legally use the template, including any restrictions.</li><li><strong>Commercial vs. Non-Commercial Use</strong>: Some templates are only licensed for non-commercial use. If you’re using it for commercial purposes, ensure the template is cleared for such use.</li><li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: Some licenses require you to credit the creator of the template. Make sure to follow these requirements where applicable.</li><li><strong>Modifications and Derivative Works</strong>: Be aware of any restrictions on modifying the template or creating derivative works based on it.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139107/17108" target="_top" id="2139107">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139107" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139107/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, the information in this guide will be useful when you’re looking for the perfect DJ video template download.

Loop is similar to traditional YouTube videos, but it can be played on a TV screen like a traditional TV show. Loop is a great way to keep viewers engaged with your content. It’s like a one-stop shop for all your content needs. You can use it to promote your latest video series.</p><p>Why <strong>looping YouTube videos on a TV</strong> is a great idea? First, it can be a fun way to watch your favorite videos without having to worry about the time. Second, it can be a way to save money on your cable. By watching your favorite videos on loop, you can cut down on the number of times you need to watch them.</p><p>If you are watching a series of videos, for example, looping them can help you to remember what happened in each one. Secondly, it can help you to learn new information more easily. If you are watching a tutorial or a video about a new topic, looping can help you to remember the details better.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-apple.svg"                      alt="iOS"                ></a> <a href="https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/badges-google.svg"                      alt="Android"                ></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Create-a-Loop-Video-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Create-a-Loop-Video-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Create a Loop Video for YouTube"></a>Part 1: How to Create a Loop Video for YouTube</h2><p>There is a lot of debate around whether or not creating a loop video is necessary for success on YouTube.

The good news is that time spent on YouTube is on the rise around the world. There’s no reason you can’t have a slice of that gigantic pie.</p><p>When it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >running a successful YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it’s all about subscribers. The more subscribers you attract, the more your videos will be viewed and shared online. In fact, YouTube confirms that subscribers watch double the number of videos non-subscribers do. So, getting more people to subscribe to your channel will certainly increase the number of views and engagement your videos get.</p><p>It’s no wonder the rate at which channels’ subscribers grow is an important metric in YouTube’s algorithm. The channels with the best rate of subscriber growth get featured. It’s not about suddenly skyrocketing to stardom, though. It’s about consistent growth. So, as a YouTube creator, <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/25-smart-and-proven-tactics--how-to-get-your-youtube-302.html" >growing your subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should definitely be a top priority.</p><p>There are many tips out there on how to go about <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/the-top-10-smartest-ways-to-promote-your-youtube-channel-311.html" >increasing your YouTube subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. In this post, we share 4 simple and smart tricks to get the process rolling.</p><ol><li><a href="#links"><strong>Make Sure All Your Links Are Subscribe Links</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="#sort">Sort Your Videos Into Playlists</a></strong></li><li><a href="#trailer"><strong>Create a Channel Trailer or Set a Featured Video</strong></a></li><li><a href="#rivals"><strong>Add Your Rivals To Your Tags</strong></a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS"><a href="#1-MAKE-SURE-ALL-YOUR-LINKS-ARE-SUBSCRIBE-LINKS" class="headerlink" title="1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS"></a><strong>1. MAKE SURE ALL YOUR LINKS ARE SUBSCRIBE LINKS</strong></h2><p>This point is key. By making all your links subscribe links anytime you link to your channel, you make sure that anyone who views your channel is prompted to subscribe. Subscribe links create a pop-up once viewers reach your channel. It’s a bold move that can give you instant results especially if you are referring traffic to your YouTube channel from other social media platforms.</p><p>All you need do is add ‘_?sub_confirmation&#x3D;1_’ at the end of all your YouTube links and there’ll be a pop-up whenever people click.</p><p>Now, it’s true that YouTube’s subscribe button isn’t exactly hidden. The bright red subscribe button can be found beneath all videos and at the top right side of every channel’s homepage. However, including your own subscribe link (via a YouTube card or in your video’s description) allows you to write a message that creates a sense of urgency which can produce fast results especially when people are really interested in watching your videos.</p><h2 id="2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS"><a href="#2-SORT-YOUR-VIDEOS-INTO-PLAYLISTS" class="headerlink" title="2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS"></a><strong>2. SORT YOUR VIDEOS INTO PLAYLISTS</strong></h2><p>Playlists have long been a part of our entertainment experience. Whether on our iPods or via apps like SoundCloud or Spotify, playlists make it easy for us to find and access the kind of content we like. But playlists aren’t just for music. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/creating-and-managing-youtube-playlists-88.html" >Creating playlists on your YouTube channel <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a very smart move. It gives your subscribers and viewers added value they will appreciate. Part of the hassle of being online these days is trying to find the content you actually want to consume because you have to wade through so much content you aren’t actually interested in. By taking the work out of finding related content, you actually increase the chances that your viewers will stay longer on your channel and watch more of your videos.</p><p>You can also create playlists to curate content by other YouTube creators. As long as your curated content falls within your chosen category, and also complements your channel, you should go for it. In a way, creating curated playlists makes it easier to convince non-subscribed viewers that you understand the sort of content they like, and your channel is one to watch. Seeing that you know the best content and creators for a particular topic might just be the thing that convinces non-subscribed viewers to sign-on to receive updates from your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO"><a href="#3-CREATE-A-CHANNEL-TRAILER-OR-SET-A-FEATURED-VIDEO" class="headerlink" title="3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO"></a><strong>3. CREATE A CHANNEL TRAILER OR SET A FEATURED VIDEO</strong></h2><p>Most dedicated YouTube creators have made <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >channel trailers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s their chance to give visitors a taste of what they’re all about in a short and exciting video. YouTube trailers are a sure way to hook viewers and you should definitely make one if you want to increase your channel subscribers fast.</p><p>YouTube channel trailers are usually under a minute long. In less than 60 seconds, you can showcase your best videos and get viewers excited about what you have to offer. You may choose to employ the sorts of clever videography we see in movie trailers. With so many open source and free video editing programs, doing this is actually not as difficult as you might think. The bottom line is that a YouTube trailer can be a creative and effective way of creating buzz about your channel and ultimately, growing your subscribers.</p><p>That said, you don’t have to make a YouTube channel trailer if you don’t want to. Setting a featured video can be just as effective. Featuring your most popular video will make a b first impression on people who visit your channel and increase the likelihood that they’ll click the subscribe button. Featuring your most recent video will keep your channel looking fresh.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134246/18498" target="_top" id="2134246">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134246" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134246/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS"><a href="#4-ADD-YOUR-RIVALS-TO-YOUR-TAGS" class="headerlink" title="4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS"></a><strong>4. ADD YOUR RIVALS TO YOUR TAGS</strong></h2><p>Adding your rival’s names to your tags might sound a bit underhanded, but it’s a fair way of increasing the chances that your content will show up as related to theirs. The trick is to choose rivals whose content ranks highest for the category or group related to your own content.</p><p>To find your rivals, simply search for your video titles. If your video is very popular and you’ve optimized it well enough, it may rank tops in your search. In most cases, however, the search results will show someone else’s content at the top of the list. Adding the names of the top 3 creators on that search list to your video’s tags will increase the likelihood that your video will be presented to viewers as related to theirs. When your video shows up as related to a top-ranking video, the chance that it will be viewed is increased significantly. And in addition, the more you are seen to create content that’s similar to the best videos, the more viewers are likely to subscribe to your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2><p>The tips on this list are simple, straightforward, and sure to deliver results.

There are 10 different categories including popular channel types like makeup and gaming.</p><p>You have two options for every template: PSD and PNG. If you have Photoshop you’ll be able to edit the PSD file and, if you don’t, you can use the PNG as your banner background when you build your channel art in a free online program like Canva.</p><h4 id="2-Behance"><a href="#2-Behance" class="headerlink" title="2. Behance"></a>2. Behance</h4><p>Behance is a gallery of creative visual works. There is a very large collection of art you could repurpose for your channel art, but some creators on the site have also created graphics specifically to be used as YouTube banners.</p><p>Here are some channel art galleries on Behance: <a class="link"   href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/10819163/Youtube-Background-Art" >Ej &#x2F; Vritra <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/11697655/Youtube-Channel-Art" >Austin Evans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>You can download PSD files from Behance and edit them in Photoshop. There isn’t a PNG or JPG option for people who don’t have Photoshop, though.</p><p>In order to download the templates you’ll need to hover your cursor over the Photoshop icon, and then click ‘Download Now’ when it appears. You’ll need to make an account before you can download.</p><h4 id="3-YourTube"><a href="#3-YourTube" class="headerlink" title="3. YourTube"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://yourtubetheme.com/youtube-channel-art-templates/" >YourTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>With over 500 templates available, YourTube has the largest selection on this list. They have every style you can think of, from minimalist to video game themed.</p><p>The site is run by two web designers who make the money they need to maintain the site from the few premium&#x2F;paid options available (although the vast majority of templates are free).</p><p>Most of the templates are JPG backgrounds which you will need to add your own text to.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036486/19272" target="_top" id="2036486">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036486" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036486/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates"><a href="#Part-2-9-Banner-Makers-with-Free-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates"></a>Part 2: 9 Banner Makers with Free Templates</h2><p>In this section you’ll find 9 YouTube channel art makers.</p><h4 id="1-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#1-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="2-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#2-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Spark"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://spark.adobe.com/make/youtube-channel-art-maker" >Adobe Spark <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>To edit the templates available through Adobe Spark, just click on the resources in the template and then click on the images&#x2F;fonts&#x2F;etc you want to substitute in. Resources like filters are also very accessible.</p><p>Everything you do in Spark starts with clicking on an element in the template. You won’t see all of the menus at once, just the ones related to the element you’ve selected (i.e. the background image or the text).</p><p>The only downside of Spark is that free downloads include a watermark. The silver lining is that that watermark is small and located in the bottom-right corner, meaning that it won’t show up for viewers watching your channel on either computers or mobile devices.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> for some reason when you click ‘Create your YouTube channel art’ it will load a thumbnail template instead of a banner template. Click Resize in the side menu to switch to channel art or your exported image won’t be big enough.</em></p><h4 id="3-BeFunky"><a href="#3-BeFunky" class="headerlink" title="3. BeFunky"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.befunky.com/" >BeFunky <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a graphics creator that doubles as a banner maker. You’ll need to enter BeFunky’s ‘Designer’ tool in order to find the channel art templates under ‘Social Media Headers’ and ‘YouTube’. There’s actually only 1 free channel art template, but it is a very standard channel art layout which you can customize with your own images.</p><h4 id="4-Canva"><a href="#4-Canva" class="headerlink" title="4. Canva"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Canva is one of the most popular free channel art makers. It is an easy to use, drag and drop, program that will automatically resize images to work in the spaces you drag them to. It has great free resources like stock photos. Some resources are paid ($1), but many are free.</p><p>The templates on Canva do tend to include paid resources, but it’s easy enough to swap them out with free resources or your own images.</p><h4 id="5-Crello"><a href="#5-Crello" class="headerlink" title="5. Crello"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://blog.crello.com/a-collection-of-free-youtube-channel-art-templates/" >Crello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Crello offers 10 examples free channel art templates through their blog, and you can even edit the templates right on the site.</p><p>Crello is an easy to use visual editor created for social media and marketing, meaning that it was made to be easy for non-designers to jump into. Beyond the free templates and text options, however, most of their stock photos and backgrounds cost $1. To use Crello for free you either need to use the default images, or upload your own.</p><h4 id="6-Design-Wizard"><a href="#6-Design-Wizard" class="headerlink" title="6. Design Wizard"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.designwizard.com/" >Design Wizard <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is another program with a small number of free templates that you can make almost anything out of through customization. One of the most useful features of design wizard is that it will show you the ‘safe zone’ – the area of your banner that will show up on any device screen – so you can design with that in mind.</p><p>Remember to delete the safe zone marker before you export.</p><h4 id="7-Fotor"><a href="#7-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="7. Fotor"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/features/youtube.html" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another graphics program with free templates for YouTube channel art. Fotor is easy to use – perhaps the easiest program on this list to use. In the ‘background’ tab you don’t even have to drag and drop, you just click on the element in your template and then click on what you want to replace it with. You can even load in your own images.</p><p>There are paid options in Fotor which will add a watermark to your design unless you upgrade to their paid service, but there are enough free options to satisfy most creators.</p><h4 id="8-Snappa"><a href="#8-Snappa" class="headerlink" title="8. Snappa"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://snappa.com/create/youtube-channel-art" >Snappa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you want to get something made fast, Snappa can do that. Just find YouTube Channel Art under Headers and choose one of the free templates (there are a lot). Then it’s just a matter of swapping out the elements in the template with ones that suit your channel and clicking download.</p><p>Snappa shows you the safe areas for different devices while you edit.</p><h4 id="9-Visme"><a href="#9-Visme" class="headerlink" title="9.

The banner maker is a big more complicated than some of the other makers on this list (it has a lot of options that are more for marketers than YouTubers, which weighs it down a bit), but the free templates are great and you can upload your own images to use with them.</p><p>How did you make your banner?

The less effort you have to put into the technical side of editing, the more energy you can devote to being creative.</p><p>In the main screen of Filmora, you are never more than a couple clicks away from any basic, advanced, or creative feature you want to use. The built-in music library, a wide selection of text and title options, filters, overlays, animated elements, and split-screen options can all be accessed from a clearly labeled toolbar above the timeline.</p><p>Besides fun things like filters, Filmora also has powerful tools like advanced color grading and an audio equalizer. Either of these features can be accessed in two clicks from the main editing screen. With your audio or video clip selected, simply click the editing icon and then either Advanced (for expanded color editing options) or Customize (for the audio equalizer).</p><p>Even features like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >picture-in-picture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (PIP) and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >green screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are easy to use in Filmora. The PIP tracks are right under the main video track in your timeline. Although there is only one when you start a project, you can have up to ten. These PIP tracks can be used to layer photos and videos over top of each other. One of the most popular uses for the PIP track is facecam videos. After you drag your facecam footage into the PIP track, you can easily shrink it and move it to the corner of your main video.</p><p>The green screen has its own designated icon on the main toolbar. Simply select a clip or image in one of your PIP tracks and click it to access the feature.</p><p>Filmora is always adding new features to make editing even easier for online video creators. A few of the other tools included in Filmora are speed control, text customization, tilt-shift, ripple delete, and an audio mixer.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Video-Editing-Software-Comparisons"><a href="#Part-2-Video-Editing-Software-Comparisons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Video Editing Software Comparisons"></a><strong>Part 2: Video Editing Software Comparisons</strong></h2><p>Here is a ‘top 4’ list of other popular video editors.

Movie Maker has different timeline tracks for things like videos and music, and it is very easy to trim or cut up all of your media clips. The ability to sharpen some of your blurrier images, speed control, and a simple title generator, and some basic transitions are some of the program’s more noteworthy features.</p><p>Movie Maker does not come close to matching Filmora’s range of features, but it is easy to use. It could be a good option for video creators who have no room in their budget for paid software. Videos made in Movie Maker will be simple, but that is all some people need.</p><h4 id="Vegas-Movie-Studio"><a href="#Vegas-Movie-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Movie Studio"></a><strong>Vegas Movie Studio</strong></h4><p>Vegas Movie Studio, which used to be Sony Vegas, is a big step up from Movie Maker. While editing your clips, you can adjust their brightness, contrast, and color balance. On the audio side of things, Vegas has a great audio restoration tool you can use to get rid of unwanted background noises.</p><p>Although it does not have filters, overlays, and animated elements like Filmora, Vegas does have some very modern-looking titles and transition effects.</p><p>The biggest advantage that Filmora has over Vegas is that it is a lot easier to use. Vegas has some great features, but accessing and using them is not something you can just jump into doing. Filmora is so intuitive that most users can just open it up and start applying effects.</p><p>Vegas is very reasonably priced at $49.95 USD, but it is only $10 more for the ease and effect variety of Filmora.</p><h3 id="Section-2-Mac-Video-Editors"><a href="#Section-2-Mac-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: Mac Video Editors"></a><strong>Section 2: Mac Video Editors</strong></h3><p>Here are two of the most popular video editors for the Mac OS:</p><h4 id="iMovie"><a href="#iMovie" class="headerlink" title="iMovie"></a><strong>iMovie</strong></h4><p>iMovie comes free with Mac computers, and it is a huge step up from Windows Movie Maker. It has some really nice audio editing tools, like an equalizer and the ability to set fade in and fade out times (which Filmora also has). When you are editing video clips, iMovie provides you with a stabilization tool, speed controls, and even some filters and overlays. There are text and title options available as well, although they are very basic.</p><p>The main difference between Filmora and iMovie is variety. Filmora has a huge range of titles in different styles; iMovie has everyday fonts with all the traditional credit&#x2F;title animations. iMovie has close to the same amount of features as Filmora, but there is always less variety in those features, and they tend to feel dated.</p><p>The main difference between iMovie and every other editor on this list is the layout. The timeline is located in the top left portion of the screen, not stretched across the bottom, and the clips&#x2F;sounds do not sit in different tracks. The iMovie interface is not actually very complicated, but it will be an adjustment for anybody used to a more traditional editing experience.</p><h4 id="Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="Final Cut Pro X"></a><strong>Final Cut Pro X</strong></h4><p>Final Cut Pro is Apple’s attempt at a professional-grade editing program. It is much more advanced than iMovie and offers 64-bit architecture and background rendering. Background rendering means that your imported clips are prepared for playback before you actually move them into your timeline, making the editing process a lot faster.</p><p>Final Cut Pro also boasts a huge selection of editing tools.</p><p>Like iMovie, Final Cut Pro does not use a traditional timeline. This will make it easier to learn for users upgrading from iMovie, but potentially more difficult for users coming from any other program. Final Cut Pro would be competition for Adobe Premiere if it were available on anything except the latest Mac OS.</p><p>Final Cut Pro X costs $300, making it a significant investment.</p><h3 id="Section-3-Online-Video-Editors"><a href="#Section-3-Online-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Section 3: Online Video Editors"></a><strong>Section 3: Online Video Editors</strong></h3><h4 id="WeVideo"><a href="#WeVideo" class="headerlink" title="WeVideo"></a><strong>WeVideo</strong></h4><p>WeVideo is a fairly simple cloud-based video editor. Its most useful feature is that it gives your team the ability to edit collaboratively. Multiple editors can upload footage and create their own edits of the project.</p><p>WeVideo has all of the most basic editing features – the abilities to trim clips, add transitions, and give your project a soundtrack. Other than the potential for collaboration, though, it has nothing that free programs like iMovie, and even Windows Movie Maker, do not have.</p><p>There are a few different pricing options for WeVideo. You can use it for free, but your storage space and the number of features you have access to will be very limited. Your videos will also be watermarked. Also, both the free and $19 packages limit your video resolution to 720p. You will need to pay at least $39 for 1080p, and it will cost you $69 to get rid of all the storage limits.</p><p>If you are going to pay $69 for video editing software, you are much better off using Filmora.</p><h3 id="Section-4-The-Pro-Choice"><a href="#Section-4-The-Pro-Choice" class="headerlink" title="Section 4: The Pro-Choice"></a><strong>Section 4: The Pro-Choice</strong></h3><h4 id="Adobe-Premiere"><a href="#Adobe-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="Adobe Premiere"></a><strong>Adobe Premiere</strong></h4><p>Adobe Premiere is a professional editing software. In terms of functionality, it has every program on this list, including Filmora, beat. It has very powerful video and audio editing tools, and the program can be customized to suit the needs of particular projects.</p><p>Because it is designed for professionals and veteran editors, Premiere is far from a simple program. If you have not edited a video before, or are used to a simpler program, it will take you a long time to become good at using Premiere (it might be a good idea to find an online course).</p><p>It does have a few features designed to save time, such as an automatic audio syncing tool and the ability to apply changes you have made to one clip across multiple other clips.

It has supplied so much information that it took this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >comprehensive post about Analytics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to highlight all the insights. So why would YouTube change it?</p><p>Change to a popular social media platform is always worrisome to content creators because it means there will be a new learning phase forced upon them. While the Classic YouTube Creator Studio has a lot of features and functionality, the data was often hard to interpret and inconvenient to find. Many creators weren’t sure where their data was located or how to use the information presented to them.</p><p>YouTube Studio was designed to be a friendly management and analysis tool. YouTube also offers more guidance, showcasing the key metrics the algorithm uses to evaluate the success of a video more prominently. Additionally, the graphs presented offer more clarity, shortening the time a creator spends finding the information they need.</p><p>Undoubtedly, YouTube updated its Creator Studio to offer a tool that enables its users to better understand their video performance and make better content that serves YouTube’s requirements.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484950/16446" target="_top" id="1484950">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484950" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484950/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta"><a href="#Intro-to-YouTube-Studio-Beta" class="headerlink" title="Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)"></a>Intro to YouTube Studio (Beta)</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Studio Beta"                ></p><p>YouTube Studio (Beta), for many YouTubers, is now the default. However, for the time being, creators can still switch back to the Classic view (as some of the features are still being built). YouTube’s objective is to receive data of their own by understanding how creators are using the new Studio and gaining feedback to improve upon it.</p><p>If you have any feedback, simply click on this button on the bottom left menu of the YouTube Studio (Beta) and send YouTube your thoughts.</p><p>In addition to the new layout of the tools and dashboards, YouTube Studio (Beta) will also debut 3 metrics for creators:</p><p><strong>1. Impressions</strong>: See the total reach of all your videos or each individual video. Each time your video thumbnail and title are visible to the user counts as an impression.</p><p><strong>2. Click-through rate</strong>: Determine how click-worthy your thumbnails and titles are, by seeing the percentage of people who click into your video.</p><p><strong>3. Unique viewers</strong>: Know how many different people have watched your videos. This data can be used to compare the size of your subscriber base to the actual number of your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-Studio-Beta-Features" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features"></a>Tips for Using YouTube Studio Beta Features</h2><p>Now that you are more familiar with the new YouTube Studio (Beta), let us dive into what you can accomplish with all the new features.</p><h4 id="1-Optimization-Tips"><a href="#1-Optimization-Tips" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimization Tips"></a>1. Optimization Tips</h4><p>In the past, there has been a lot of speculations about how creators should treat their video titles and descriptions.

If YouTube identifies a notable issue with your video, they will help you by offering tips, which you can click “Tell Me More” to look into.</p><p>YouTube wants you to know how your videos are performing in the first few days. In order for YouTube to determine whether your content is worth sharing, it wants to know how your audience is responding to it right away. This means, the launch of your video matters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-recent-video-data.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068433/7443" target="_top" id="2068433">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068433" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068433/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Video-Analysis"><a href="#3-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Analysis"></a>3. Video Analysis</h4><p>In the Classic Creator Studio, you couldn’t get an aggregated view of all the important video data on one dashboard. You would have to click to each set of analytics individually and then dive deeper. This ate up your precious content creation time and made it hard to combine insights. Now with Studio Beta, you can see all the critical data in one spot. Right away, you can see how that video is performing through different factors. This will let you know where audience retention is dropping off or which traffic source is supplying most of the views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-video-analysis.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Video Analysis"                ></p><h4 id="4-Watch-Time-Funnel"><a href="#4-Watch-Time-Funnel" class="headerlink" title="4. Watch Time Funnel"></a>4. Watch Time Funnel</h4><p>The objective is to increase watch time, the metric YouTube puts the most weight on. With the new Watch Time Funnel, which you can find in the Analytics section under the Reach Viewer dashboard, you can see exactly at which level of your channel or wherein an individual video you will need to improve.</p><p>If the impression numbers are low, that means you need to improve how your video is being discovered by doing more research to understand what your viewers are searching for.</p><p>If the click-through rate (CTR) is low, then you will have to improve your thumbnail and title. This will better entice your audience to click. According to Google, half of all videos have an average CTR of 2-10%.</p><p>If the average view duration is not up to your standards, then you will have to improve your content itself. While it is most ideal to have all your viewers watch all the way to the end of all your videos, that is certainly unrealistic. However, 60-70% is a great number to aim towards.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-beta-watch-time-funnel.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Creator Studio Watch Time Funnel"                ></p><h4 id="5-Traffic-Sources"><a href="#5-Traffic-Sources" class="headerlink" title="5. Traffic Sources"></a>5. Traffic Sources</h4><p>YouTube now presents all the different traffic sources in one easy-to-find page in the Reach Viewer tab, so creators no longer have to click between them to analyze where their traffic is coming from. This new design is far less intimidating and messy. At a glance, you can now see where the majority of your audiences are coming from.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-studio-traffic-source.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Studio Traffic Source"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>YouTube has always put a lot of value into its analytic tools, and with YouTube Studio Beta the features and design are continuously improving.

Now funny people can reach millions of viewers on YouTube, and all they need are funny video ideas. <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/how-to-come-up-with-better-youtube-video-ideas-391.html" >Generating great video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t always easy, but I’m here to help you get over that minor speed bump.</p><p>Let’s dive into the world of YouTube comedy videos and find out which ideas can help you launch your career as a comedian.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="7-Comedy-YouTube-Video-Ideas"><a href="#7-Comedy-YouTube-Video-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas"></a>7 Comedy YouTube Video Ideas</h2><ol><li><a href="#one">Do a Skit</a></li><li><a href="#two">Start a Funny Series</a></li><li><a href="#three">Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</a></li><li><a href="#four">Machinima and Gameplay Skits</a></li><li><a href="#five">Parody Videos</a></li><li><a href="#six">Bloopers</a></li><li><a href="#seven">Lip Sync Video</a></li></ol><h4 id="1-Do-a-Skit"><a href="#1-Do-a-Skit" class="headerlink" title="1. Do a Skit"></a>1. Do a Skit</h4><p>YouTube is the perfect medium for short, generally between one and ten minutes long comedy sketches. The majority of the audience on YouTube isn’t patient enough to sit through a half-hour show, no matter how funny it is (at least not until you have a large fan base).</p><p>Your skit can be about literally anything, as long as it’s short and effective. Having your own unique sense of humor is a crucial factor in ensuring the success of the sketches you post online.</p><h4 id="2-Start-a-Funny-Series"><a href="#2-Start-a-Funny-Series" class="headerlink" title="2. Start a Funny Series"></a>2. Start a Funny Series</h4><p>Try producing a pilot episode of a comedy series for your YouTube channel. Don’t worry about the budget too much because if your ideas are good even a DIY approach will be enough.</p><p>Producing a funny series requires dedication and commitment to that goal, so don’t let yourself be discouraged easily.</p><h4 id="3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos"><a href="#3-Kid-Baby-and-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos"></a>3. Kid, Baby, and Animal Videos</h4><p>Posting cute videos on your YouTube channel will certainly help you get attention online. The Internet loves videos of adorable babies, cats, dogs and other charming animals. Including these types of videos on your channel can be a good way to boost your subscriber count.</p><p>It is important to note that your content must be unique. Re-posting funny animal videos you find online won’t get you far and will make it impossible to monetize your channel.</p><h4 id="4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits"><a href="#4-Machinima-and-Gameplay-Skits" class="headerlink" title="4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits"></a>4. Machinima and Gameplay Skits</h4><p>The term machinima means creating a cinematic production by re-using material from video games. Gameplay skits and machinima videos are a great way of reaching millions of gaming fans who enjoy good comedy videos.</p><p>The gaming industry is on the rise, and the audience that wants to watch video game-related content is growing every day. However, these types of videos require an in-depth knowledge of the gaming world, and you really have to know the games you draw from in order to make this idea work.</p><h4 id="5-Parody-Video"><a href="#5-Parody-Video" class="headerlink" title="5. Parody Video"></a>5. Parody Video</h4><p>A well done, poignant parody never fails to make people laugh. Pop culture provides an endless source of TV shows, movies, and songs that can be used for your parody videos. When pop stars release big new music videos, they always get parodied by someone on YouTube within the first few days in order to capitalize on the trend while it’s fresh.</p><p>Parody videos will provide you with an opportunity to showcase your skills and enable you to show the world that you are a talented, relevant comedian.</p><h4 id="6-Bloopers"><a href="#6-Bloopers" class="headerlink" title="6. Bloopers"></a>6. Bloopers</h4><p>We all make mistakes. Blooper videos enable us to at least laugh at them. Experienced YouTubers know how easy it is to flub a take, but it takes a brave creator to make an entire video from the shots they messed up.</p><h4 id="7-Lip-Sync-Video"><a href="#7-Lip-Sync-Video" class="headerlink" title="7. Lip-Sync Video"></a>7. Lip-Sync Video</h4><p>Have you ever imagined what it’s like to be a pop star? Lip-sync videos offer the opportunity to step into someone else’s shoes for a moment and have fun with it. Knowing the song you’re lip-syncing and having good timing can help, but you can hardly go wrong producing a video of yourself pouring your soul into a song you’re lip-syncing.</p><p>Lip-syncing to tunes from the most popular stars in the world will enable you to gain traffic from people looking for content related to those songs and artists.</p><p>Need more YouTube video ideas?

It’s the ideal way to create, distribute, and measure the overall success of your films on YouTube, Google+, and the web. It provides powerful editing tools, real-time feedback on how your films are performing, and one-click posting from your PC or smartphone. YouTube Studio provides several features:</p><h4 id="1-Manages-Multiple-Channels"><a href="#1-Manages-Multiple-Channels" class="headerlink" title="1. Manages Multiple Channels"></a>1.

Simply select Manage Channels from the account icon in the top right corner.

It includes a few basic features, but if you want to do some serious altering, you’ll need a third-party program.</p><p>Modern video editing software is fairly complex, and it allows you to make professional-looking movies without a lot of training.

In order to gain any momentum, you’ll have to decide on a particular thing you want to be known for. That’s your niche.</p><p>People looking for beauty tutorials are often looking for someone who has something in particular in common with them. Hairstyling for a specific ethnicity, for example, is a potential niche because people want to learn how to style their own hair, not a hair in general.</p><p>Another way you could find a niche is by taking on a specific area of interest, like a skincare channel with a focus on coping with acne or a makeup channel with a focus on natural products.</p><p>  SunKissAlba has a lifestyle channel that focuses on a ‘natural’ niche. She posts videos about every aspect of her lifestyle from putting on makeup to cooking, but natural&#x2F;non-toxic products are a constant theme through everything she does. By niching her channel she hasn’t limited what kinds of videos she can do at all - she posts a huge variety of different types of videos. What she has done is to make her channel particularly valuable to audiences interested in things that are natural or organic.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy"><a href="#Types-of-Beauty-Videos-–-Your-Content-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy"></a><strong>Types of Beauty Videos – Your Content Strategy</strong></h2><p>It’s a lot easier to come up with weekly video ideas when you have an overarching strategy.</p><p>The easiest way to figure out what kinds of videos you should make (and this can also help determine your niche!) is to think about what you already do and enjoy. If skincare is particularly important to you, for example, then you could build a content strategy that includes things like your favorite sunscreen, what different ingredients in skincare products are for, or even how to make a DIY face mask.</p><p>The same thing goes if you love doing big glamourous makeups for going out. Think about what you like, and that will determine what you should talk about in your videos.</p><p>Instead of buying new products to use in videos, try to use and showcase what you already have.</p><p>Here are some common types of beauty and lifestyle videos:</p><p><strong><em>Get Ready With Me:</em></strong> a video where you put your makeup on which helps your audience get to know you better.</p><p><strong><em>Monthly Favorites:</em></strong> showcases your favorite products from the last month.</p><p><strong><em>Makeup Collection:</em></strong> viewers will want to see what you have.</p><p><strong><em>DIY:</em></strong> create something, like a homemade moisturizer, and show your viewers how to make their own.</p><p> <strong><em>Makeup Hauls:</em></strong> show off what you’ve bought recently.</p><p><strong><em>Lookbooks:</em></strong> put together a few looks based on a theme, like a specific color or event.</p><p><strong><em>First Impressions:</em></strong> show yourself using a new product for the first time.</p><p><strong><em>Makeup Tutorials:</em></strong> teach your viewers how to achieve a particular look, like a smokey eye.</p><p><strong><em>What’s In My Bag</em></strong>: empty your handbag to show viewers what you carry around with you, particularly your most essential makeup.</p><p><strong><em>My Routine:</em></strong> show viewers your morning skincare routine, or how you usually take your makeup off before bed. Any of your beauty-related routines will be interesting to your followers.</p><p> You should also be ready to jump on trends as they jump up. You can get a bump in viewership from people searching for a particular trend. Here are a couple of examples of past trends:</p><ul><li>Boyfriend Does My Makeup</li><li>Kid’s Makeup Challenge</li><li>No Mirror Makeup Challenge</li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Get-Products-to-Review"><a href="#How-to-Get-Products-to-Review" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Products to Review"></a><strong>How to Get Products to Review</strong></h2><p> You probably already know that a lot of the products popular beauty YouTubers review in their videos were sent to them for free. Brands want to get their products into the hands of creators who have ‘influence’ both in the hopes that their audiences will decide to buy them and as part of generating buzz – getting more people talking about their products so more people become interested.</p><p>In order for a brand to consider sending you a free product to review or feature in a video, you will first have to have a large enough following.</p><p>What is ‘large enough’? There’s no magic number of YouTube subscribers or Instagram followers. How large your following needs to be will depend on what brands you want to work with, as well as whether your channel has a specific niche.</p><p>Large brands will want to work with larger creators. Smaller brands that are still trying to build notoriety may be more open to working with creators whose followings are not as large.</p><p>If you have a very specific niche then that could create more opportunities for you as a mid-sized YouTuber. If you specialize in styling curly black hair, and a brand is marketing a product made specifically for styling curly black hair, then your smaller following will be more valuable to that brand than the larger audience of a more general channel.</p><p>Here are 4 tips for getting free products for review:</p><ol><li>Follow your favorite brands on Instagram and subscribe to their YouTube channels. Make sure to take them when you feature their products in your posts or videos.</li><li>Focus on growing your community&#x2F;audience. As you start getting more subscribers and building up momentum for your channel, brands might start reaching out to you. We’ve got some <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/27-fun-and-easy-tactics-to-get-more-youtube-subscribers-405.html" >tips on growing your YouTube channel here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Make a pitch to a brand. The first step in this is figuring out who to pitch to. You can send smaller brands DMs via Instagram or Twitter and politely ask for contact info for a PR person. Never ask for free product or sponsorship at this point, just information you can use to contact PR.</li><li>Send an email with your pitch to the brand’s PR person. Your email should introduce yourself, describe your content, and talk about what type of audience you have (how many subscribers, where are they located, how old are they, etc. This information is all available in your Creator Studio analytics).<br>Make sure to link to your channel so they can verify what you say (do not hide your subscriber count).<br>Emphasize what value you could provide the brand with (i.e. ‘I’ve had a lot of success with videos on managing acne and I’m sure my subscribers would love to see a review of your cream’) and outline what kind of video you’d like to make (i.e. a five-minute review focusing on the product, or a short feature in a longer makeup tutorial).</li></ol><h2 id="Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers"><a href="#Simple-Camera-Setup-for-Beauty-Vloggers" class="headerlink" title="Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers"></a><strong>Simple Camera Setup for Beauty Vloggers</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of different ways to set up your camera for a ‘talking head’ video (anything that is primarily you talking to the camera).

Having a concrete plan before you start recording will help ensure your tutorial is useful for viewers. You’ll realize where you might need to slow down and show a particular step in more detail, or where your viewers might find a particular step tricky, in a way you want if you just jump into a makeup routine you know perfectly.</li><li><strong><em>Layout your supplies.</em></strong> Make sure everything you need for your tutorial is laid out neatly in front of you so you can access it all easily. Try to use clean brushes – it just looks nicer.</li><li><strong><em>Tidy up.</em></strong> If you want your viewers to trust you when it comes to aesthetics, it’s important that your studio area is clean and tidy. You may even want to use a backdrop.</li><li><strong><em>Do a video test.</em></strong> Before you start your video for real, start recording and shoot some test footage. Watch that back to make sure you like the look of your frame, your face is never blurry, and you’re happy with the overall look of things.</li><li><strong><em>Do an audio test.</em></strong> If you’re going to be talking in your video instead of recording a voiceover after, do an audio test to make sure your audience will be able to hear you clearly.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044582/7443" target="_top" id="2044582">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044582" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044582/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-Recording" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – Recording</strong></h2><p>Here are some things to keep in mind while you record your makeup tutorial:</p><ol><li><strong><em>Show what you’re using.</em></strong> When you use a product, brush, or any other beauty supply make sure to let your audience know what you’re using and why you chose it. This isn’t about promoting brands, it’s about making it easy for viewers to duplicate your results.<br>If you’re using autofocus, you can hold products up to the screen and wait for it to kick in. If you’re not using autofocus, just hold them up next to you for a moment. You can also shoot separate closeups of each product and cut them into your main tutorial video.</li><li><strong><em>Highlight small details.</em></strong> Describe what you’re doing in a lot of detail and don’t gloss over anything. Assume the person watching your tutorial doesn’t know anything about putting on makeup.</li><li><strong><em>Take stills for your thumbnail.</em></strong> Remember to take some still photos of your finished makeup to use in your YouTube thumbnail.</li></ol><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Makeup-Tutorial-–-After-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting"></a><strong>How to Make a Makeup Tutorial – After Shooting</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve finished recording and put away all your camera gear, there’s still work to do. You still need to edit your video and post it on YouTube. Here are some tips for that:</p><ol><li><strong><em>Add transitions and effects.</em></strong> If you have several clips or even just distinct sections of your main clip, then adding transitions can be a great way to hold your viewers’ attention.<br>If you spend a lot of time on a repetitive step, you may want to speed that part up and make it a time-lapse.</li><li><strong><em>Add your intro.</em></strong> Having a short (usually around 5 seconds) intro sequence is a great way to strengthen your personal lifestyle brand. You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/free-resources.html" >download free intros right here on filmora.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li><strong><em>Title your video.</em></strong> Make sure your most important keyword – the type of look you’re creating, or a product you’re reviewing – is near the beginning of your video’s title. Searching for the topic of your video and writing a title similar to the highest-ranking results is a good way to start.<br>Remember to include what type of video you made, i.e. ‘tutorial’, ‘review’, or ‘get ready with me’, in your title. People might include these kinds of words in their search queries and, even if they find your video another way, they’ll probably want to know what they’re clicking on before they click.</li><li><strong><em>Customize your thumbnail.</em></strong> Again, search for your video’s topic and see what comes up.

TikTok’s first move was to pay selected influencers about $500 for joining the app and creating content. Creators make money from TikTok by promoting products and services of their audience as well as launching their careers through the app. Likewise, brands also get to creators through the “TikTok Creator Marketplace” platform for promotions.</p><p>You can also earn on YouTube Shorts from Google AdSense. This is an in-built video monetization that creators use for showing ads on their videos. Earnings will accumulate every month-end for withdrawal.</p><h5 id="2-Analytics"><a href="#2-Analytics" class="headerlink" title="2) Analytics"></a>2) Analytics</h5><p>Both YouTube and Shorts offer analytics like adding comments, likes, shares, and many more. Likewise, you can view your videos on either desktop or mobile platforms. With both platforms, you get an endless number of videos to watch and discover by scrolling. Also, both apps focus on short videos to entertain viewers.</p><h5 id="3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators"><a href="#3-Subscribe-directly-to-creators" class="headerlink" title="3) Subscribe directly to creators"></a>3) Subscribe directly to creators</h5><p>You can directly get in touch with both YouTube shorts and TikTok creators. This gives an open leeway to discover new creators to follow and subscribe to. All you need to do is go to the creators’ videos in both feeds and hit the “Follow” or “Subscribe” button. Henceforth, you’ll start seeing what they post and keep in touch with their signs of progress.</p><h5 id="4-Privacy"><a href="#4-Privacy" class="headerlink" title="4) Privacy"></a>4) Privacy</h5><p>Both apps have taken consideration into privacy issues. They allow creators to set their videos to either private or public. By this, your audience will only view what is set as “Public”. You can deter this by setting your content to “Private” or choosing who can view your content. This is a good aspect to let only those who wish to view certain clips as per your wish.</p><h5 id="5-Edit-video"><a href="#5-Edit-video" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit video"></a>5) Edit video</h5><p>There’s much that your video can portray. In both apps, you choose what to give to your audience. Both platforms enable you edit your video before posting. You can alter the speed by increasing or decreasing it for slow motion.

Even though YouTube Shorts allows users to create videos, it is not a platform that users can engage in communication via instant messaging app. On the other hand, TikTok lets you directly message other users as you share experiences. This makes TikTok a one-stop social media exchange point where you easily interact with your peers and get instant feedback. You can also create group chats and keep the fun going.</p><h5 id="2-In-dependability"><a href="#2-In-dependability" class="headerlink" title="2) In dependability"></a>2) In dependability</h5><p>TikTok Shorts videos also differ from the concept of stand along and built-in features. TikTok is a standalone app that doesn’t depend on another app for its normal operations. Users can independently create content directly from the app. On the contrary, Shorts is a built-in app on YouTube and users have to access it via the YouTube platform. This may be a plus for YouTube but it could eventually turn away those who want to work independently from the app.</p><h5 id="3-Interface"><a href="#3-Interface" class="headerlink" title="3) Interface"></a>3) Interface</h5><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><h3 id="What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need"><a href="#What-More-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-Your-Personal-Need" class="headerlink" title="- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need"></a>- What More Should You Consider When Choosing - Your Personal Need</h3><p>Settling on YouTube Shorts and TikTok largely depends on your preferences. But being that TikTok has been in the limelight for a longer time, it has mastered users’ and creators’ preferences, bringing more to the table than YouTube Shorts.</p><p>Both TikTok and Shorts have an immense user base. But being a standalone app, TikTok still has a chance of scaling the heights. Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen.

Yes, Shorts has some upper hand over TikTok like the ability to edit your videos after being published, a dislike button, and a scheduling tool that lets you schedule when your video goes live. TikTok is still above the cut being that it has been here long before Shorts. More so, it offers advanced editing features for quality video output.

Remember that Shorts is still in the “Beta” version and has not fully exploded even though it’s a built-in app on YouTube.</p><p>TikTok stands a chance of being chosen by many users as it is an independent platform. Users can connect with friends through news feed content or messaging. When it comes to editing tools, the app’s extensive library lets you add presets to your taste. It constantly keeps creators at bay, rolling new filters and effects for the unique creation of content. Additionally, TikTok engages users via its “Q&amp;A” feature where users can pose any hot questions to creators for answers. And beauty is that creators can respond to such comments with a video. More so, you can use the “Discovery” tab to view trending hashtags and sounds, which YouTube Shorts lack.</p><p>With TikTok, users can add video captions from the bottom left of the screen. It also comprises a large library of editing precepts like filters, greenscreen effects, among others. YouTube Shorts, on the other hand, is rich in a library of music. Users can access popular songs and directly switch to YouTube for trending videos as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087234/19272" target="_top" id="2087234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087234/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-make-quality-videos-for-the-apps-you-choose-3"><a href="#How-to-make-quality-videos-for-the-apps-you-choose-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?"></a>How to make quality videos for the apps you choose?</h2><p>Even though <strong>TikTok and YouTube Shorts</strong> both let you edit your videos, you can stile up your game with other editing apps like Filmora. This app will save your time and effort while giving you compelling video outcomes. Filmora comprises advanced features such as social import to let you import video clips and photos from social media platforms.

If you are looking for <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >short video promotion on YouTube Shorts and Tiktok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you may need to consider different things. Yes, Shorts has some upper hand over TikTok like the ability to edit your videos after being published, a dislike button, and a scheduling tool that lets you schedule when your video goes live. TikTok is still above the cut being that it has been here long before Shorts. More so, it offers advanced editing features for quality video output. Above all, it works independently, a feature that most users adore as compared to the encasing of Shorts within YouTube.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-essential-android-update-for-vr-video-watchers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Essential Android Update for VR Video Watchers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/rafting-visual-stories-in-depth-pc-editing-techniques-for-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Crafting Visual Stories In-Depth PC Editing Techniques for YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-how-to-make-a-youtube-intro-video/"><u>[Updated] 2024 | How to Make a YouTube Intro Video？</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-maximize-creativity-with-these-10-androidpc-video-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Maximize Creativity with These 10 Android/PC Video Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-making-youtube-audio-mp3s-easily-for-your-mac/"><u>[Updated] Making YouTube Audio MP3s Easily for Your Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-pick-best-vr-devices-of-the-year/"><u>2024 Approved Prime Pick Best VR Devices of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-after-switching-from-xiaomi-redmi-a2plus-to-latest-samsung-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data After Switching From Xiaomi Redmi A2+ to Latest Samsung | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ultimate-guide-to-free-pptp-vpn-for-beginners-on-oppo-reno-10-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-stop-motion-on-instagram-like-a-pro-a-beginners-guide-for-2024/"><u>New Stop Motion on Instagram Like a Pro A Beginners Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/izing-self-filmed-content-on-youtube/"><u>Optimizing Self-Filmed Content on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/struggling-to-get-into-game-mode-solving-your-rocket-league-startup-woes/"><u>Struggling to Get Into Game Mode?

Then, go to the “My Channel” panel and select the video that you want to cut. Once you’ve done this, click on the “Video manager” option and click on the “create” tab which should be located on the right side for the page. There, you will be able to find the “Video Editor”. Of course, you can also add “&#x2F;editor” to YouTube’s URL, and you would be good to go.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Import-Your-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Import-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Import Your Video"></a>Step 2 Import Your Video</h4><p>Once you’ve done all of the above, you would have to drag your video in order to cut it’s time. Keep in mind that the videos are made out of a maximum of 50 clips. The site is going to save every single video that you upload as a particular clip which could be properly combined with the rest in order to make one larger video. This is important.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-video-to-youtube-timeline.jpg"                      alt="drag video to YouTube timeline"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Edit-the-Length"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-the-Length" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Edit the Length"></a>Step 3 Edit the Length</h4><p>This is the part where you actually get to edit the length of your video. In order to do so effectively, you have to drag the bar at either end of your clip towards the other end in order to shorten the clip conveniently.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-length-in-youtube.jpg"                      alt="edit video length in youtube"                ></p><p>What is more, if you want to increase the length, you have to drag the bar to the opposite end – outwards. There is going to be an indicator which is going to appear at the bottom of the clip, and it’s going to show you the overall duration of the file, and it’s going to adjust itself as you slide the bars accordingly.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Save-the-Clip"><a href="#Step-4-Save-the-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 Save the Clip"></a>Step 4 Save the Clip</h4><p>Of course, you would have to save the clip in order for the changes to reflect. Even though this might seem like a particularly obvious thing to do, you would be surprise to find out that a lot of people get everything done and then discard the changes by forgetting to save them and their effort goes to waste.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/aster-iphone-and-ipad-best-free-video-editors-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Master iPhone & iPad Best Free Video Editors Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ro-level-7-dslrs-that-transform-your-digital-storytelling/"><u>[New] Pro-Level 7 DSLRs That Transform Your Digital Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/nlocking-online-potential-top-5-strategic-approaches-to-youtube-marketing/"><u>[New] Unlocking Online Potential - Top 5 Strategic Approaches to YouTube Marketing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-curating-youtube-music-experiences/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Curating YouTube Music Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-save-and-stream-gotomeet-on-desktops-and-phones/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Save and Stream GoToMeet on Desktops & Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-create-a-youtube-channel-trailer-to-increase-revenue-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Create a YouTube Channel Trailer to Increase Revenue for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-androidplusios-ai-curated-instavideo-mosaic/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Android+iOS AI-Curated InstaVideo Mosaic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-monetize-like-a-pro-how-to-use-youtube-studio-on-any-device-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Monetize Like a Pro How to Use Youtube Studio on Any Device for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-straight-from-the-studio-simple-steps-to-sizzling-mac-vids-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Straight From the Studio Simple Steps to Sizzling Mac Vids on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/updated-the-best-sites-for-chromium-phone-tunes-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Best Sites for Chromium Phone Tunes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/discover-the-essence-of-kinemaster-and-evaluate-10-leading-online-game-alternatives/"><u>Discover the Essence of KineMaster and Evaluate 10 Leading Online Game Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/into-diy-the-beginners-guide-to-eye-catching-mac-videos/"><u>Dive Into DIY The Beginner’s Guide to Eye-Catching Mac Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/navigating-network-passwords-in-windows-11-find-your-lost-wi-fi-key-with-this-guide/"><u>Navigating Network Passwords in Windows 11: Find Your Lost Wi-Fi Key with This Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/pc-part-harmony-the-pre-purchase-confirmation/"><u>PC Part Harmony: The Pre-Purchase Confirmation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/top-5-solutions-for-resolving-zoom-unable-to-play-videos/"><u>Top 5 Solutions for Resolving 'Zoom Unable to Play Videos'</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/top-rated-156-portable-ips-monitor-under-70-limited-time-offer-for-6599/"><u>Top Rated 15.6 Portable IPS Monitor Under $70 - Limited Time Offer for $65.99</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Check our tutorial below as we walk you through various recommended methods for resizing a YouTube thumbnail:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App"><a href="#Method-1-Resize-YouTube-Thumbnail-With-Windows-Default-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App"></a>Method 1: Resize YouTube Thumbnail With Windows Default App</h3><p>The easiest way to resize YouTube thumbnails is through the Windows default app. Within just a few modifications, you can resize your thumbnail to fit as a preview image for your YouTube video.</p><p>Please take note that your image should be at least 2 megabytes or less to achieve the perfect YouTube thumbnail fit. If your image exceeds the limit, your thumbnail will either be rejected, or your image will have a black screen around it-which is not ideal at all.</p><p>Now, let us start the tutorial.</p><p>Step1 Open an image you want to set as a thumbnail.

Programs like <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are popular for this purpose, as it offers a wide range of tools and features for editing and resizing images.</p><p>This program allows you to import an image, resize it to the dimensions required for a YouTube thumbnail (typically 1280 x 720 pixels), and save the edited version to your desired location. Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Open</strong>,” then search for the file you want to resize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-open-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp open thumbnail"                ></p><p>Step3 Click on “<strong>Image</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Scale Image</strong>“ and make sure that the resolution is 1920 by 1080.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-edit-resolution.JPG"                      alt="gimp edit resolution"                ></p><p>Step4 Click on “<strong>File</strong>“ &gt; “<strong>Export As</strong>“ and <strong>toggle</strong> the “<strong>Select File Type (By Extension)</strong>“ option. <strong>Choose</strong> JPG&#x2F;JPEG format because it can compress the thumbnail enough to stay within the limit of 2 megabytes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-format.JPG"                      alt="gimp export format"                ></p><p>Step5 You can change the quality of the image and <strong>click</strong> the “<strong>Export</strong>“ button to save the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-export-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="gimp export thumbnail"                ></p><h2 id="Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods"><a href="#Comparison-of-These-4-YouTube-Thumbnail-Resizing-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods"></a>Comparison of These 4 YouTube Thumbnail Resizing Methods</h2><p>Now that we’ve explored the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails, it’s time to compare the pros and cons of each method.

They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks.

Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software"></a>Method 4. Convert Images to YouTube Thumbnail Using Third-Party Software</h3><p>In addition to using dedicated video editing software, several third-party image editing programs can be used to resize images for use as YouTube thumbnails. Programs like <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are popular for this purpose, as it offers a wide range of tools and features for editing and resizing images.</p><p>This program allows you to import an image, resize it to the dimensions required for a YouTube thumbnail (typically 1280 x 720 pixels), and save the edited version to your desired location. Using an image editing program can be a good option if you need more control over the appearance of your thumbnail or if you want to make more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image.</p><p>To resize an image using an image editing program like GIMP, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Install and <strong>launch</strong> GIMP on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gimp-install.JPG"                      alt="gimp install"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none;

However, the quality of the resized thumbnail may improve if the original image is low resolution, and this method is only suitable for users on Windows operating systems.</p><p>Online YouTube thumbnail size converters are convenient and easy to use, and they can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. They also typically preserve the quality of the original image. However, some online converters may have size limits or require a subscription to unlock all features, and using an online converter can be slower than using a dedicated software tool.</p><p>Using Wondershare Filmora allows you to create and edit YouTube thumbnails within a single application, which can be a time-saving advantage if you’re already using Filmora for other video editing tasks. However, Filmora is a paid software, so there is a cost associated with using it, and it may have a steeper learning curve for users new to video editing.</p><p>Image editing programs like GIMP offer many features and tools for customizing your thumbnail, including adding text, applying filters, and making more extensive edits beyond simply resizing the image. They also typically offer more control over the quality and appearance of the resized thumbnail.</p><p>However, using a third-party image editing program may require a learning curve and maybe more time-consuming than other methods, and there may be a cost associated with purchasing the software.</p><p>Each of the four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails has its pros and cons, and the best method will depend on the user’s specific needs and preferences.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article explored four methods for resizing YouTube thumbnails: using the Windows default app, online converters, Wondershare Filmora, and image editing programs like GIMP.
