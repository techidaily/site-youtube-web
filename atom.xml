They started the Smosh YouTube channel in 2005 and since then they have grown their team to include more creators, and their content to include animation and gaming. Smosh has become much more than two funny guys on YouTube – it is a wildly successful content company.</p><p>Most channels that have one viral video do not go on to have sustained success on YouTube, but Smosh is an exception to this rule. Their ‘Pokemon Theme Music Video’, released in 2005, became the most viewed video of all time (as of that year). This video kick-started the growth of their channel.</p><p>In 2017, Anthony Padilla chose to leave Smosh to focus on his own solo YouTube channel.</p><h3 id="5-Fernanfloo"><a href="#5-Fernanfloo" class="headerlink" title="5.

A 24-year-old Salvadoran named Luis Fernando Flores Alvarado is the man behind one of the most subscribed YouTube channels of all time. The Fernanfloo channel was created in 2011, and in February 2014 it had only 100,000 subscribers. By August 2014, Alvarado’s channel reached 1 million subscribers, making him one of YouTube’s biggest success stories. The videos featured on Feranfloo channel mostly cover gaming topics, but with a touch of comedy which makes Alvarado’s videos unique.</p><p>At the end of 2015, Alvarado launched the Fenanfloo mobile app that had 2.3 million downloads in the first week. His videos are mostly in Spanish which somewhat limits his audience, but it is safe to say the Fernanfloo channel is among the most popular channels in the Latin American countries since most of his audience comes from Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p><p> For tips on becoming YouTube famous like the creators above, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"

That is to remove all update options. How to do that, follow the below-mentioned steps you can do so.</p><p>On your smartphone, open the <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> or <strong>Manage Apps</strong> option &gt; choose <strong>YouTube</strong> app&gt; at the top right end, click on three dots there &gt; click on <strong>Uninstall Updates</strong>. That will replace your YouTube app with that of the older version of YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/disable-youtube-shorts-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Using this method, you can remove shorts easily from YouTube. And, it is not going to take much amount of time. So, go and follow the steps.</p><h3 id="Method-7-Try-YouTube-Vanced"><a href="#Method-7-Try-YouTube-Vanced" class="headerlink" title="Method 7: Try YouTube Vanced"></a>Method 7: Try YouTube Vanced</h3><p>Wait, the list is not over yet. If none of the previous methods work, try <strong>YouTube Vanced</strong>, the advanced and premium version of YouTube to get rid of YouTube Shorts. Well, not only that, but YouTube Vanced also comes up with multiple services that you can enjoy along with it, such as disabling YouTube Shorts, blocking ads, stories, or any of the sponsored features.</p><p>If not sure how to go about it, then let’s have a look over the following steps that will guide you to get YouTube Vanced.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download YouTube Vanced</strong></p><p>First, download the YouTube Vanced application from its website.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Install and complete the setup process</strong></p><p>After that, complete the installation process and follow the on-screen direction rightly to make it work effectively for you.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are downloading from the website, not from the app store, then there might appear the warning. So ignore that and go with the downloading and installation process.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Open application and visit settings</strong></p><p>Once you have launched the application, under the settings, you need to go for the <strong>Vanced settings</strong> option&gt; there opt for “Ad settings” &gt; at the end of the page, switch on the <strong>Shorts shelf</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/disable-youtube-shorts-5.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><p>Doing so will disable the YouTube Shorts option from the <strong>Home</strong> screen.</p><p>Alternatively, remove the <strong>YouTube Shorts</strong> button also from the screen. Under the “Vanced settings” &gt; Visit <strong>Layout settings</strong> &gt; Switch on the <strong>Comments location</strong> option. That will further remove the Shorts button from the bottom end of the Home screen of the YouTube page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/disable-youtube-shorts-6.jpg"                      alt="filmora"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/947746/11832" target="_top" id="947746">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-947746" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/947746/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Voila, now you can say that you get rid of those shorts videos by removing shorts from YouTube using YouTube Vanced option.</p><p>Thus, following the methods mentioned above gives you multiple ways to turn off shorts on YouTube.

Here you should refer to YouTube for its guidelines, whilst they do accept a number of file formats, digging through the YouTube help system to find the settings for highest quality we find that they recommend MPEG4 as the container, using the  codec.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/youtube-recommended-settings.png"                      alt="youtube-recommended-settings"                ></p><p> We can also see further recommended settings in this screenshot that will be covered later.</p><p> The good news is that Premiere automatically selects the appropriate container for us when we select our codec, however it is worth knowing the file type YouTube is expecting just to check yourself.</p><h4 id="3-Video-Codec"><a href="#3-Video-Codec" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Codec"></a>3. Video Codec</h4><p> So having established that YouTube recommends the MPEG4 container using the  codec, the first option we need to look for in the media export dialogue is to select the appropriate Format.</p><p> This is the first drop down in the dialogue box, and in this case we simply select  from the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/choosing-format.png"                      alt="choosing-format"                ></p><p> Once you select  you can check the ‘output name’ field and see that premiere is automatically set the output file to .mp4 which is exactly what we need.</p><h4 id="4-Preset"><a href="#4-Preset" class="headerlink" title="4. Preset"></a>4. Preset</h4><p> The next field we come to is the ‘Preset’ dropdown menu. This is a major help to most people, as Adobe have very kindly included large numbers of presets to quickly adapt video settings to suit specific uses. They vary depending on the exact version of Premiere you are using, and each format type does have its own list of presets,  as we can see has a large number for YouTube, but also has many presets for specific devices (presets for iPad, Kindle, Nook, various other tablets and phones, Vimeo and a host of others) to make getting the right settings that bit easier for us.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/presets.png"                      alt="presets"                ></p><p> It is important here to select the correct preset from the various YouTube options. You want to select the resolution and frame rate that match your source file, for the best results. So, if your source file is 1080p with a frame rate of 29.97 fps then that is the YouTube setting you would select.</p><p> Once a preset is selected a summary of the settings is displayed below, normally these will be well suited to your project, however you can fine tune anything you wish by selecting the video or audio tabs at the bottom which give you the chance to adjust each parameter individually. If you do this, you can save these changes as a custom preset by clicking the button at the side of the Preset dropdown menu and simply use it on later projects by selecting it from the list the same as any other, a great time saving tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/finetuning.png"                      alt="finetuning"                ></p><h4 id="5-Rendering"><a href="#5-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="5. Rendering"></a>5. Rendering</h4><p> Once you are satisfied with the settings, either from the Preset alone or if you have adjusted anything yourself, you are nearly ready to render the file and export it.</p><p> For YouTube it is recommended you select the ‘Use Maximum Render Quality’ option to maintain the best output you can, it does add time to the render process but if you value the quality of your work it is worthwhile.</p><p> Finally you can choose a suitable filename and the destination of the file by clicking on the ‘Output Name’ field.</p><p> I normally use a filename that includes the destination medium so I can differentiate between different versions of a project and know which one to upload where, in this case I include ‘youtube’, but if I were planning on uploading clips of the project to vimeo as well for instance there may be a cut of the project with ‘vimeo’ in the name too. The destination is personal preference, because I do use filenames to differentiate versions I can put the various iterations into a single project file, others have folder structures for each type of file , so all YouTube output goes into a single folder and so on, how you organize is entirely dependent on how you work.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/filename.png"                      alt="filename"                ></p><p> Once those are selected clicking ‘Export’ starts the rendering process, and eventually (how long depends on the speed of your computer and the size and type of file involved), you will end up with your YouTube optimized video in the location you chose.</p><p> Here I created 4 key frames that let the ‘Animation’ object move around the ‘Demo Text’ Object and finally come to rest below it. Whilst this type of effect does look very effective on screen, such is the ease of use of After Effects it really is just a few minutes work to achieve.</p><p> Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to add text in Premiere &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-Uploading"><a href="#6-Uploading" class="headerlink" title="6. Uploading"></a>6. Uploading</h4><p> Now you have your file, the next step is to go to your YouTube account and log in if you need to.</p><p> On the top of your homepage on the right is the upload button, selecting that brings up the select file menu as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-menu.png"                      alt="upload-menu"                ></p><p> You can either drag your file into the window or click on it to open a standard file browser to locate the desired file, click and the upload will begin. The dropdown underneath allows you to set the video as Public, Unlisted or Private. You can change this at any time once the video is uploaded as well.</p><p> This opens the upload progress window, where you can add in a name, description and tags as well as add the video to a playlist or adjust the privacy settings as the video is uploading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/upload-progress.png"                      alt="upload-progress"                ></p><p> Once the upload as finished, you can do final adjustments to settings and choose a thumbnail for the video. The final step is to click the ‘Publish’ button and your video will be processed and go live.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-maximizing-reach-understanding-tag-importance-for-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Maximizing Reach Understanding Tag Importance for Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/core-your-youtube-content-with-these-free-sounds-for-2024/"><u>[New] Score Your YouTube Content With These Free Sounds for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-camera-operational-obs-challenge-won-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Camera Operational OBS Challenge Won for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-engage-and-learn-students-choice-of-best-historical-youtubes-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Engage & Learn Students' Choice of Best Historical YouTubes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-finding-the-right-mic-a-guide-for-multifaceted-yt-channels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Finding the Right Mic A Guide for Multifaceted YT Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-youtube-recommended-videos-block-the-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, YouTube Recommended Videos - Block the Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-youtubes-forgotten-footage-watching-deleted-content-made-easy/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Youtube's Forgotten Footage Watching Deleted Content Made Easy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-delving-into-tseries-streaming-revenue-model-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved Delving Into TSeries' Streaming Revenue Model on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-rising-viewers-rising-prosperity-the-youtube-route/"><u>2024 Approved Rising Viewers, Rising Prosperity The Youtube Route</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ple-yet-powerful-strategies-to-skyrocket-your-youtube-views-for-2024/"><u>5 Simple Yet Powerful Strategies to Skyrocket Your YouTube Views for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/boosting-gaming-and-work-fast-track-to-updating-your-intel-iris-plus-gpu-drivers/"><u>Boosting Gaming & Work – Fast Track to Updating Your Intel Iris Plus GPU Drivers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/data-phoenix-rises-download-stellar-now/"><u>Data Phoenix Rises – Download Stellar Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-sony-xperia-5-v-to-other-android-devices-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Contacts from Sony Xperia 5 V to Other Android Devices Devices?

Creating custom channel art is a great way to express yourself and communicate the tone of your videos.</p><p>YouTube supports JPG, GIF, BMP, and PNG files for channel art, although they do not allow animated GIFs.</p><h4 id="Part-1-Top-Sites-for-YouTube-Channel-Art"><a href="#Part-1-Top-Sites-for-YouTube-Channel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Top Sites for YouTube Channel Art"></a><strong>Part 1: Top Sites for YouTube Channel Art</strong></h4><p>You can make your channel art in Photoshop, or another photo editing program, but there are also some excellent tools online which you can access for free. Here are two of the best:</p><p><strong>Canva.com</strong></p><p>Canva has templates for YouTube banners as well as a variety of stock images. You can also upload and edit your own images on Canva. It is a free service, but they do have some premium features which cost $1 each. Canva has a desktop version and an iPad app.</p><p><strong>PicMonkey.com</strong></p><p>PicMonkey lets you import images from your computer or social media accounts, edit them, and use them in templates for YouTube banners or other kinds of social media graphics. It’s free to use, but you can only access their more advanced editing tools if you buy a paid subscription for either $4.99 a month, or $2.75 a month for a year.</p><h4 id="Part-2-Banners"><a href="#Part-2-Banners" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Banners"></a><strong>Part 2: Banners</strong></h4><p>Your banner is the header for your channel page. Its dimensions are 2560 x 1440 px.</p><p>Not all of your banner will be visible on all devices. The full 2560 x 1440 px image will only be seen by viewers watching on tv screens.</p><p>Only 1546 x 423 px of your banner will be visible on computers, and this ‘safe area’ can vary for different tablets and smartphones depending on the width of their screens. Make sure any important text or logos are placed in a central location so everybody can see them.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that your icon will hover over the top left corner of your banner and that your social media icons will be located in the bottom right corner.</p><p>The file size of your banner cannot be over 4MB.</p><h4 id="Part-3-Icons"><a href="#Part-3-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Icons"></a><strong>Part 3: Icons</strong></h4><p>Your icon is the avatar you use when leaving and replying to comments on YouTube. It also hovers over your banner on your channel page.</p><p>By default, your icon will be the picture associated with your Google account.</p><p>If you upload a new icon, it will render down to 98 x 98 px. So, any square image larger than 98 x 98 px will work. However, YouTube recommends you use one as large as 800 x 800 px. This will give you a sharper, higher quality, image.</p><h4 id="Part-4-Thumbnails"><a href="#Part-4-Thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Thumbnails"></a><strong>Part 4: Thumbnails</strong></h4><p>Thumbnails are the images that represent your videos on your channel page and in search results.</p><p>You can browse through your video and choose a still frame you want to use as your video’s thumbnail. Or, you can upload a custom image.</p><p>Custom thumbnails should have an aspect ratio of 16:9, the same as YouTube’s video player. The files should be under 2MB and have a resolution of 1280 x 720.</p><p>To upload a custom thumbnail, select the <strong>custom thumbnail</strong> option under <strong>Video Thumbnails</strong> at the end of the video uploading process. You can also change the thumbnails of your existing videos to custom ones through <strong>Video Manager</strong>.</p><p>Remember that your thumbnail will be rendered down to a much smaller size. If you use text, like the title of your video, then you should make it really big so that it is easy to read when it gets shrunk down.</p><h4 id="Part-5-Watermarks"><a href="#Part-5-Watermarks" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Watermarks"></a><strong>Part 5: Watermarks</strong></h4><p>A watermark is a small, usually 50 x 50 px image displayed in the bottom right corner of your video.</p><p>Watermarks protect your videos by making them harder for others to steal and take credit for.</p><p>Ideally, your watermark will be a transparent version of your logo. Try not to use more than three colors – you do not want your watermark to distract your viewers.</p><p>If you add a <strong>branding watermark</strong> through YouTube then that watermark will also double as a subscribe link.</p><p>Here is how you can add a branding watermark through YouTube:</p><ol><li>On YouTube, go to your <strong>Creator Studio</strong> and select <strong>Branding</strong> under the <strong>Channel</strong> menu.</li><li>Click the blue <strong>add a watermark</strong> button on the <strong>Branding</strong> page.</li><li>An <strong>upload of a watermark</strong> window will pop up.

Let’s start by taking a look at the best YouTube keyword tools available.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-autocomplete"><a href="#1-YouTube-autocomplete" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube autocomplete"></a>1. YouTube autocomplete</h4><p>When you start to search for something on YouTube, you’ll probably notice that YouTube suggests some keywords to finish your search. This is called autocomplete, and it works by suggesting the most popular keywords that start with the letters you’ve typed so far. What it is essentially saying is that those are the most frequently searched for terms that use the words you’ve already typed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-complete.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>This means it’s a great place to start building your keywords, and a fantastic YouTube keyword tool for your videos. Just start your search for your video (e.g. shoes for…) and see what comes up. In this case, we can see that the most popular keywords are ‘girls’, ‘men’, ‘kids’, ‘summer’ and ‘boys’.</p><h4 id="2-Keywordtool-io"><a href="#2-Keywordtool-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Keywordtool.io"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keywordtool.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Without doubt, this is one of the most powerful YouTube keyword tools out there, ranking hundreds of keywords by popularity. It captures data from YouTube autocomplete and allows you to create lists of keywords from that data. As well as autocompete data, you can also search for questions people are asking, which makes it highly beneficial as a YouTube SEO tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>The downside to this particular tool is that it’s fairly limited on the free version. Upgrading to Pro Basic will give you almost double the keyword results and will let you compare the volume of searches made for those terms too. However, this will set you back around $68 a year, so it’s going to be something of an investment if you go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io-result.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool "                ></p><h4 id="3-SEOChat"><a href="#3-SEOChat" class="headerlink" title="3. SEOChat"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://seochat.io/tools/keyword-suggest-tool" >SEOChat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>SEO Chat is an amazing free tool that can generate keyword ideas from Google, Amazon, Bing and YouTube. You can search for keywords from all of those sources or can just search YouTube alone to find your keyword lists. You’ll need a ‘seed’ keyword, such as ‘shoes’, ‘make up’ or ‘marketing’, and then organizes results alphabetically with other letters following your seed keyword.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seochat-youtube.jpg"                      alt="SEOChat youtube keyword tool SEOChat"                ></p><p>Simply scrolling through the results is going to give you loads of ideas for keywords and possibly content too. The tool also allows you to further expand your results by selecting a keyword and running ‘part two’ of the process, which expands those phrases even further. Your chosen keywords can be exported from the software, ready for use in your YouTube SEO tool.</p><h4 id="4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor"><a href="#4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor" class="headerlink" title="4. Gather keywords from your competitor"></a>4. Gather keywords from your competitor</h4><p>Why not learn from the best and see what’s already working for your competitors? Finding their high traffic keywords is easy and can save a lot of time and energy. To do this, pick a channel that is around your size, as they’re your nearest competitors. Steer clear of the huge channels, as you’ll find it hard to rank next to them.</p><p>Click the videos tab to see their content, and sort them by ‘most popular’ to see the ones which got the most views. Take a look at the <strong>title</strong> and the <strong>description</strong> of those videos, and you’ll find a good fistful of proven keywords that you can start using yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/most-popular-video-youtube-channel.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>That’s not all though. To maximize your competitor research, let’s dig a little deeper into the <strong>tags</strong> they have used for their videos too. Unfortunately, these are hidden on YouTube, but are easily seen using the page’s HTML. Simply right click on the page and select ‘view source’. Don’t be alarmed at the great stream of HTML that pops up, it’s easy to search using your search function (press ctrl + f on Windows or ⌘ + f on iOS) by typing in ‘keywords’ to the search box. The following terms are the tags used in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-keywords-youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>If ploughing through HTML sounds somewhat taxing, there is a handy YouTube SEO tool you can use to display the tags on page. It’s called <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy-for-youtube/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and is a Chrome extension which you’ll find in the Chrome store for free.</p><h4 id="5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator"><a href="#5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator" class="headerlink" title="5. Keyword Tool Dominator"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.keywordtooldominator.com/k/youtube-keyword-tool" >Keyword Tool Dominator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>It’s got a grand name, but it’s actually really easy to use and a great place to start if you’re new to YouTube keyword research. Pop in your seed keywords and the Dominator will produce a list of relevant keywords related to those terms. You can then select the most useful and download them to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Keyword-tool-dominator.jpg"                      alt="tool for youtube keyword"                ></p><p>The drawback with this is that you can only perform three searches a day on the free version. Perhaps that’s enough for you to begin with, but if you want to upgrade to the unlimited version, which will also give you search volumes, it’s a one-off fee of $39.99.</p><h4 id="6-Ubersuggest"><a href="#6-Ubersuggest" class="headerlink" title="6. Ubersuggest"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For getting more data on specific keywords, Ubersuggest from the SEO guru that is Neil Patel is one of the best tools out there. As well as showing search volume and competition, you can see other information such as cost per click and the seasonality of the keyword. It’s free to use with no limitations at all, so is well worth checking out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ubersuggest-youtube-keywords.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="7-Google-trends"><a href="#7-Google-trends" class="headerlink" title="7. Google trends"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >Google trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>We would highly recommend investigating Google Trends as part of your YouTube keyword research, as it is powerful, accurate and, best of all, free! The options let you narrow down the trend results to just YouTube searches, which is great for gaining insights to your search terms. You can narrow down the results to a specific country too, helping you to gain insight into what your target demographic is currently interested in.</p><h4 id="8-VidIQ"><a href="#8-VidIQ" class="headerlink" title="8. VidIQ"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The keyword tool in VidIQ is one of very few research tools that has a function for just YouTube built in. You can paste in the keywords you want to research, choose the country you wish to target, and it will return all the search volumes and amount of competition, and will score your keywords based on these figures.</p><p>On the downside, there is a fairly complicated subscription process to go through if you want to upgrade from the free version. To be honest, the free version is OK for new users, but for in depth analytics you’re going to want to upgrade eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-vidiq.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool VidIQ"                ></p><h4 id="9-Keyword-Keg"><a href="#9-Keyword-Keg" class="headerlink" title="9. Keyword Keg"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordkeg.com/youtube-keyword-tool.html" >Keyword Keg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Keyword Keg is definitely one of the most powerful YouTube keyword research tools out there. It offers lots of data, drawn from a variety of data sources including Wikipedia, Alibaba, Playstore and more.

But, do you know what would be even better than that? Getting your video ranking on Google as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-video-result-keywords.jpg"                      alt="Google video result keywords"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To do this you’ll need to find ‘video result keywords’ in Google, so that yours can be one of the selected videos that sometimes show up in search. Google decides what should and shouldn’t trigger a video result, and usually shows them when a video would make sense, for example when someone asks ‘how to’ or searches for ‘cute’ or ‘funny’ things.</p><p>There’s a bit of trial and error involved as there is no YouTube keyword tool to find video result keywords… yet. But you can use Google to search your keywords and see if they are video result keywords. Just type them in, and if a video appears in the listings below, you’ve discovered a video result keyword that is well worth optimizing for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ismantling-youtube-ranks-factors-and-their-effects/"><u>[New] Dismantling YouTube Ranks Factors and Their Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-streamlining-video-transfer-from-imovie-to-youtube-platform/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamlining Video Transfer From iMovie to YouTube Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-elevate-your-edits-a-selection-of-top-9-free-software-choices/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Edits A Selection of Top 9 Free Software Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-optimizing-ad-reach-on-social-medias-leading-platform/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Optimizing Ad Reach on Social Media's Leading Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-10-online-subtitle-converters-for-free-convert-srt-files/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 10 Online Subtitle Converters for FREE Convert SRT Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-youtube-growth-strategy-attracting-million-strong-fans/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Youtube Growth Strategy Attracting Million-Strong Fans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ing-viewership-with-animated-subscribe-buttons-in-filmora-easy-guide-for-2024/"><u>Boosting Viewership with Animated Subscribe Buttons in Filmora (Easy Guide) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/e-and-stand-out-50-free-youtube-branding-pieces-in-2024/"><u>Dazzle and Stand Out 50 FREE YouTube Branding Pieces, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-turn-off-find-my-apple-iphone-11-pro-when-phone-is-broken-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Turn Off Find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro when Phone is Broken? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-access-your-iphone-se-2020-when-you-forget-the-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Access Your iPhone SE (2020) When You Forget the Passcode? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/instant-success-code-five-keys-of-chatgpts-triumph/"><u>Instant Success Code: Five Keys of ChatGPT's Triumph</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/1723010787943-modern-warfare-woes-no-more-your-ultimate-guide-to-overcoming-dev-error-6034-on-ps-xbox-and-pc/"><u>Modern Warfare Woes No More: Your Ultimate Guide to Overcoming Dev Error 6034 on PS, Xbox & PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/quick-update-guide-for-windows-and-a6200-netgear-dongle/"><u>Quick Update Guide for Windows & A6200 Netgear Dongle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/transform-scripted-text-into-storytelling-magic-for-2024/"><u>Transform Scripted Text Into Storytelling Magic for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

YouTube will then get this information and use it to rank your video.</p><p>For this reason, you have to know the keywords that best identify your videos and have the potential to attract viewers to your channel.</p><h4 id="2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title"><a href="#2-Use-a-Good-Video-Title" class="headerlink" title="2.

You might want to use high-quality, high-contrast images with a 16:9 aspect ratio. YouTube will choose which frame it will display as the video thumbnail. The platform will present three screenshots that you can choose from; however, you can upload your image or select a shot of another moment in the video.</p><p>Remember that YouTube overlays the duration of the video in the corner of your thumbnail. So make sure it does not obstruct any relevant details in your thumbnail. Google also uses image recognition to filter out specific imagery, including the YouTube logo.</p><p>Ideally, you need an image that is a perfect visual representation of the keywords you are targeting. In turn, this is going to take your presence in relevant search results even further.</p><h4 id="9-Make-High-Quality-Longer"><a href="#9-Make-High-Quality-Longer" class="headerlink" title="9.

The duration of most of the videos in the first five positions is usually 11 minutes 44 seconds. Therefore, you need to invest in longer videos that are around 10 minutes long. These videos meet the expectations of many users seeking complete and in-depth content. Additionally, you should create high-quality videos to ensure your viewers will keep watching.</p><h4 id="Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Create-High-Quality-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora"></a>Create High-Quality YouTube Video with Filmora</h4><p>Wondershare’s Filmora program allows you to edit your video content with trim, transitions, and overlays.

Showing your face on a Youtube thumbnail makes it more appealing to users to click and listen to the person who is being shown in the thumbnail. Humans are more inclined towards faces. When there is a human element in a video, it increases its effectiveness. Check out the pics below, which one are you most likely to click through?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/comparison-of-showing-face-or-not.png"                      alt="comparison-of-showing-face-or-not"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Simple-Fonts"><a href="#Use-Simple-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Use Simple Fonts"></a>Use Simple Fonts</h4></li></ol><p>With your face, it is necessary to put some text on your Youtube thumbnail to let viewers know what this video is all about without clicking or watching it. Don’t use fancy fonts on Youtube thumbnail. It makes it hard for the viewers to read and understand what to expect in the video, especially for those watching YouTube on their 5 inches screen smartphone, ultimately decreasing the chances of your video being clicked and watched. I personally recommend you to use give these fonts a go while making YouTube thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simple-fonts-recommended.png"                      alt="simple-fonts-recommended"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li><h4 id="Use-Phrases-not-sentence"><a href="#Use-Phrases-not-sentence" class="headerlink" title="Use Phrases, not sentence"></a>Use Phrases, not sentence</h4></li></ol><p>If you have ever noticed, Youtube thumbnails are very small in size, making it hard for viewers to notice any small elements. According to <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/howyoutubeworks/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, more than 70% of Youtube watch time comes from mobile devices. While adding text in a thumbnail, instead of using sentences, make sure to use only words and make them large in size that can easily be noticed on small screens. Summurise your video in no more than 5 words.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage.png"                      alt="piechart-youtube-watchtime-percentage"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-phrases-not-sentences.jpg"                      alt="use-phrases-not-sentences"                ></p><ol><li><h4 id="Put-every-stuff-on-left-side"><a href="#Put-every-stuff-on-left-side" class="headerlink" title="Put every stuff on left side"></a>Put every stuff on left side</h4></li></ol><p>When we navigate to a Youtube thumbnail and place the cursor on it, it shows us two icons, “Watch Later” and “Add to Queue,” located on its right size.

It is one of the best ways to show the viewers the content of your video even when they don’t click on your video. These three seconds will help them decide whether to click on your video or not. This preview is selected by the system from the first half of your video according to its relevance and similarity with the topic. That’s why it is very important to add related information in the first half of the video, otherwise, Youtube will choose it randomly.

Teachers can now collaborate, connect and innovate with a multitude of students in ways that were never imagined before by employing the power of YouTube.</p><p><strong>Enhances the comprehension of complex topics</strong></p><p> Certain subjects are technical in nature and teachers usually have a hard time explaining them to the students. By using YouTube in the classroom, teachers are an a better position to offer clear and easy to understand illustrations which will in turn demystify the tough concepts and make it easy for students to understand and comprehend complex topics.</p><p><strong>Creates more engagement from students</strong></p><p> Learning primarily comprises of audio and visual components. Unlike traditional modes of teaching where the teacher offered explanation and the students are expected to take notes, videos are more engaging and has the power to make students stay more alert, thus increase their chances of absorbing the lesions and getting most from the subjects.</p><p><strong>Ideal for slow learners</strong></p><p> When using YouTube in the classroom, the teacher has full control on the pace of learning and this is ideal for taking of both the fast and slow learners. In case a student finds a concept being explained too fast, they can simply request the part to be replayed or it can be slowed down to play at a pace that will be easy for them to grasp.</p><p><strong>One teacher, multiple classrooms</strong></p><p> The other benefit of using YouTube in the classroom is that after a teacher prepares his learning videos, they get the flexibility using the video in more than just one classroom. It also makes it easy for them when they are away and they need to attend classes. All they have to do is to use the prerecorded video lesions so that they don’t entirely miss out on classes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130889/7443" target="_top" id="2130889">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130889/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-Using-YouTube-in-Classroom"><a href="#Tips-for-Using-YouTube-in-Classroom" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Using YouTube in Classroom"></a>Tips for Using YouTube in Classroom</h2><p> For teachers and tutors, there are various ways of using YouTube in the classroom.

This is especially important when teaching on tough subjects or when reviewing for exams.</li><li><strong>Short clips to put a topic in context</strong> – there are documentary channels such as National Geographic, BBC and Channel 4 amongst others where teachers can obtain and play short clips to put the subject matter into proper context for the students.</li><li><strong>Archive your work</strong>– use videos to keep a clean and neat record of the various lessons thus making it easy for current and future students to access them with ease.</li><li><strong>Review for exams</strong> – when exams are just about the corner, videos become very effective in helping the student to refresh their minds on tough topics that might require a lot of time to review during exams.</li><li><strong>Flip lessons</strong>– flipped learning is taking strong roots in most of the learning institutions and it becomes easy and efficient when using videos in the classroom.</li><li><strong>Teach when you are absent</strong> – instead of missing class or having a guest teacher to stand in for you, you can simply record the lesson on your YouTube channel or simply give out instructions for the students to follow when you are away.</li><li><strong>Allow students to gain in-depth information</strong>– by using YouTube in classroom, teachers are essentially allowing their students to dig deeper and comprehend the lessons better.</li><li><strong>Help the struggling students</strong> – videos are great for the slow learners since they can rewind or play it at their own pace.</li><li><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong> – this is to contain all the videos relevant to a particular subject or lesion for current and future students.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049363/7443" target="_top" id="2049363">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049363" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049363/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-discover-the-best-educational-videos-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube"></a>How to discover the best educational videos on YouTube</h2><p> YouTube is awash with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >millions of videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and it is imperative that you know how to search for and discover the best education videos.

As a YouTuber, you become a business, and it helps to know the YouTube views to money earned.</p><p>If you are trying to earn a living on YouTube, one of the most excellent marks of a successful creator is often earning 1 million views on the platform (<a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/24-smart-ways-that-actually-work---how-to-grow-309.html" >click here for tips on how to do that <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). It usually serves as a benchmark for a time at which a channel is relatively sustainable. However, rather than meaning a YouTuber has made it big financially, reaching 1 million views is more likely to say they can expect to <em>start</em> making real money.</p><p>When you hit 1 million views on any video on YouTube, you’ll have a nice paycheck. You’ll likely have to hit 1 million views on at least a few other videos before you could consider quitting your full-time job and doing YouTube as your primary source of income. This article will explore what 1 million views mean for your YouTube channel. We will look more into how revenue is calculated on YouTube and what you can expect to earn-out of a video with 1 million views.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">$2000 for 1 million views</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How is the revenue calculated?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">CPMs and CPCs</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How monetization is changing</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="2000-for-1-Million-Views"><a href="#2000-for-1-Million-Views" class="headerlink" title="$2000 for 1 Million Views"></a>$2000 for 1 Million Views</h2><p>In <a class="link"   href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3018123/a-million-youtube-views-wont-pay-your-rent-but-tubestart-could" >a case study performed by Standupbits <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Josef Holm, a YouTube channel is created with over 3500 comedy clips that a comedian and stand up actor had put together over the years. The YouTube clips took extensive time to upload, and the library was prevalent. The YouTube ad revenue only equated to around $2000.</p><p>Although StandUpBits had uploaded thousands of clips and received over 1 million views on their channel, their library was only able to earn around $2000 from the ad revenue sharing. It’s estimated the group had spent approximately $25,000 to finish off the clips, edit them, and upload them, which means they invested far more in the channel than they earned.</p><p>If you are thinking about a career on YouTube, reaching 1 million views might seem like an excellent target for making a successful page, and it is, but reaching 1 million views doesn’t magically guarantee financial success.</p><h2 id="How-Revenue-is-Calculated"><a href="#How-Revenue-is-Calculated" class="headerlink" title="How Revenue is Calculated"></a>How Revenue is Calculated</h2><p>In order to understand how revenue is calculated over the YouTube marketplace, a YouTube user needs to first understand what the partnership program entails. Basically, a YouTube partner has the ability to monetize their videos and serve ads on their content.</p><p>In order to join this program you need to be able to commit to uploading ad-friendly (nothing controversial) content that is completely original and high quality and which also adheres to all of the community guidelines and YouTube’s Terms of Service (YouTube actually just introduced a couple of stricter rules - click here for <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-monetization-2018---the-new-rules-everyone-hates-331.html" >YouTube Monetization 2018 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p><p>As of February 2018, to qualify for ad revenue, the YouTube channel must have:</p><p>1.

Your CPM is usually related to the demographics of your users, the content you regularly post, the length of time on the videos that you post, and the gender of your viewers. YouTube CPMs can vary depending on the advertising bid the company has submitted with Google. The lowest bids can be around .33 cents per thousand views, and other advertisers can spend as much as $10 for 1000 views.</p><p>For example, gaming is the most prominent genre on YouTube, and there are many gaming-related ads to go around, but most of them are very low-paying (i.e., ads for free online games). Only YouTube gamers with extensive subscriber bases get higher-paying ads.</p><h3 id="What-is-CPC"><a href="#What-is-CPC" class="headerlink" title="What is CPC?"></a>What is CPC?</h3><p>CPC means ‘cost per click.’ A CPC ad interprets an ‘ad impression’ as a click on an ad rather than a viewer merely seeing it. Most YouTube ads are CPC ads, but skippable video ads are CPV (cost per view), and impressions are based on viewers watching the ad instead of skipping it.</p><h2 id="Changes-on-YouTube-and-How-You-Can-Earn-More"><a href="#Changes-on-YouTube-and-How-You-Can-Earn-More" class="headerlink" title="Changes on YouTube and How You Can Earn More"></a>Changes on YouTube and How You Can Earn More</h2><p>Changes that have affected the way that revenue is calculated are the ability to skip ads and the lower click rates on advertising through YouTube.

It does matter where your viewers are going to be viewing from, and the audience that your viewers are in (viewers from areas with more disposable income to spend on the products advertised to them are worth more to advertisers, as are viewers who are interested in higher-cost items).</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/tips-for-youtube-brand-deals-from-marketing-pro-amanda-haines-171.html" >Forming relationships with brands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and doing product placements or sponsored videos can be a great way to earn more revenue than you will through AdSense. Just make sure the brands you build relationships with are relevant to your audience and that you incorporate the advertising in ways that don’t annoy your viewers.</p><p>Use the right keywords in your titles, descriptions, and tags. Without this keyword information, YouTube may pair your video with advertisers that aren’t right for your audience. First, using the wrong keywords won’t put your content in front of the viewers who want to see it, and, second, the ads that run won’t be a good fit and thus are less likely to be clicked on. It’s also imperative that you focus on the metadata of every video. It can take some extra time to add in all of this information for each video, but it is well worth it if you are trying to get paid from YouTube.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-subscriber-boost%21-the-4-simplest-tricks-to-grow-your-317.html" >Click here for 4 ways to start growing your channel faster. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>So, how much does YouTube pay for 1 million views?

It has ironical expressions that give the song its speciality. These songs are different when it comes to different singers or different artists. This is because every artist has their style and speciality which they include while composing their Parody songs. It can even be in the form of general style music.</p><p>Parody culture was first recognized in the 14th century and it has been named as one of the most artistically expressed devices.</p><p>There are various types of Parodies’,</p><ul><li>Film Parody</li><li>Poetic Parody</li><li>Self- Parody</li></ul><p>Parody is more frequently used when it comes to political announcements in the U.S.A.</p><p>Parody is in no way, shape or form fundamentally ironical, and may some of the time be finished with deference and energy about the subject in question, without being a remiss snide assault.</p><p>It is also used as a communicative dialogue bridge between cultures or at times subcultures.</p><p>Each endeavor at a Parody isn’t made similarly as a satire, and in each occurrence, the specific farce would need to experience the four-factor reasonable use examination to decide if it establishes a reasonable use.</p><p>In later occasions, the term melodic parody came to connote the hilarious utilization of new messages to previous vocal pieces, just as both genuine and amusing references to specific melodic styles</p><p> <strong>Top 10 Parody Songs:</strong></p><ul><li>Amish paradise</li></ul><p>“Weird Al” Yankovic has his style when it comes to composing Parody songs. He raps the everyday difficulties faced by people in a Humorous way. The thing which most caught my eye was the fact that the surroundings were made simple but the song has its way of making one crack up with laughter. Having around 4 decades of experience in Music Yankovic was one of the most famous composers of his time. People found it lucky to have their songs Parodied down by him.</p><ul><li>I gotta feeling- College Humour:</li></ul><p>Back in the days, this was one of the most popular Parody. It got a few dazzling feedbacks which made teenagers go crazy on the song. Its lyrics define how the frat parties at colleges end up with hangovers and some hazy memories of them logging out from the world. With his cell phones and a very few clues how a drunk guy figures out what happened the night of the party is what the whole song is about.</p><ul><li>White and Nerdy:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song. It revolves around the lines that a Man ‘can’t roll with the gangsters’ because he is too ‘White and Nerdy’.</p><p>This refers to all the Nerds out there who are more concerned about computer programs, Video games, Comics, Fancy dresses like superman or watching the Stars wars movies hundreds of times. This is one of the biggest hits of the century and was considered to be one of the funniest songs ever made.</p><ul><li>She was beautiful, I swear:</li></ul><p>The Parody by Kevin sage revolves around the topic that he sees a girl on a subway but how she turned out to be a man. It starts by him swearing that he thought she was a girl, but as you all guessed reality was something much more hilariously colourful. He was too drunk to differentiate between a man and a woman. But well, it is too late to face the truth, isn’t it?</p><ul><li>Look at this Instagram- College Humour:</li></ul><p>It revolves around how the social App Instagram is used. It is used to make other people jealous of how awesome your life. At least that is how Nickelback portrays it to be. The way her picture is so cute or the food she ate is delicious. The fact that her vacation at the beach was magnificent or the dress she bought was beautiful is how the whole song is written to be. Instagram users are made fun of in a harmless way about how they seem obsessed with their puppies or kittens.</p><ul><li>Tacky:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic describes the song about how tacky he is, or how he seems to eat food out of Instagram (Ironically of course). He talks about how he wears his sandals with socks or how he wears his belt with suspenders. It is a weirdly satisfying song.</p><ul><li>Fat:</li></ul><p>“Weird Al,” Yankovic wrote this song describes how fat a man is. He used Michael Jacksons song to make a Parody and this wasn’t the first time he did that. This video won the Grammy award for being the Best Concept Music Video ever. The video starts with a fat man walking and singing out all the problems he faces because of being fat.</p><ul><li>Telephone:</li></ul><p>A very famous and brilliant song. The video starts with the dialogue, “Will you tell me the concept of this telephone video or not’. This revolves around Lady Gaga. Maybe her weird costumes or her quirkiness.</p><ul><li>Gangnam style:</li></ul><p>Let’s face it, it is the most popular Parody which almost every citizen from the whole world had heard. Bark Baker has around 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube just because of this song. The most hilarious and also musically sound video which took over the entire industry with its massive hit.</p><ul><li>A complicated song:</li></ul><p>Another, massive hit by the famous “Weird Al,” Yankovic. This music video is divided into three parts. Each of them describing one of the weirdest situations the composer finds himself in. One revolves around too much pizza, the second one around the girl he loved but the fact that she was going to propose his cousin and the third one is about he almost knocked off this head while standing on a roller coaster ride.</p><p> Other famous Parody songs,</p><ul><li>Somebody that I used to know</li><li>Lose yourself</li><li>A lot</li><li>Friday</li><li>Poker face</li><li>Call me maybe</li><li>Hello</li><li>Beat it</li><li>Hooked on polkas</li><li>Boom Boom Pow</li><li>Party in the U.S.A</li><li>She’s always a woman</li><li>Best song ever</li><li>New rules</li><li>I’m a believer</li><li>All about that Bass</li><li>Tic Tok</li><li>Humble</li><li>I want a new Duck</li><li>Rehab</li><li>Blurred lines</li><li>Can’t feel my face</li></ul><p> Basics on how to make a Parody video:</p><p> Tips,</p><ul><li>Outline the structure of the song you want to write</li></ul><p>It is essential to pen down your ideas and structure it first instead of directly jumping to the finale. It can be done by putting down your primary theme at the top of the page and then penning the sub-themes. Try to simplify the meaning. Make note of all the important stuff.</p><ul><li>Try matching all the syllables</li></ul><p>Match the syllables of the Parody with the lyrics of the original composition. This is what gives the song its flavour. Start by counting the number of syllables in both the versions and try matching them as much as you can to give the same feel.</p><ul><li>Be active</li></ul><p>Don’t be lazy. Think and rethink all your ideas. Start looking for inspiration around you. Keep your mind active at all times. Who knows, something might strike you when you least expect it.</p><ul><li>Use the Thesaurus tool</li></ul><p>Make use of the internet and the tools it provides to beautify your work.</p><ul><li>Try speaking the words out loud</li></ul><p>Language can be confusing.

The most punctual realized spoof masses date from the late fourteenth century and the technique got basic in the fifteenth and sixteenth 100 of years. Parody, in music, initially the inventive adjusting of a few voice portions of a prior synthesis to frame another organization, as often as possible a mass; in present-day melodic use, spoof, as a rule, alludes to the comical impersonation of a genuine piece.</p><p>Spoofs can target VIPs, government officials, creators, a style or pattern, or some other intriguing subject.</p><p>Parody is significant because it permits us to condemn and address without being forceful or noxious.

We’ve developed this YouTube Money Calculator, a simple tool that lets you see at a glance how much you could be earning from your videos and channel.

For the creator, this is the amount of money they make per thousand ad impressions).</p><p>YouTube calculators will never be able to know the CPM for a YouTube channel as the rates vary for different channels and different ads. Disclosing your CPM is against the rules, so there’s not a lot of information out there to go on.</p><p>However, by taking an average of some of the current CPM rates from advertisers on YouTube, calculators are able to average out what a YouTube channel could be making. Keep in mind that, usually, the numbers that they use can be a bit on the high side compared to actual earnings. At times, though, these calculators can be very close.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator"><a href="#Part-2-The-Free-YouTube-Money-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator"></a>Part 2: The Free YouTube Money Calculator</h2><p>The YouTube Money Calculator is a free calculator tool that allows you to estimate the money obtained from any YouTube video. Calculations are entirely based on the number of views and an average CPM of $2 - $5. A user just needs to insert the total number of video views that they think they can get or that another channel has to discover how much a person could earn or be earning.</p><p>If you don’t know your CPM yet, don’t worry because our tool can give you an estimated revenue calculation based on a commonly accepted range of CPM figures for your views. Using this number, the YouTube Money Calculator can give you potential revenue by video as well as by channel on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. Let’s take a look:</p><ul><li><a href="#videos">1.

If you don’t know your CPM, the tool will automatically select a typical range based on the number of views.</p><p>From here you can start to play around and see what the impact could be of a different number of views and different CPM range. Do keep in mind that these figures are estimated, and there are many factors that come into play to determine your final CPM rate.</p><p>If you want to go deeper into your research and discover how much revenue a specific video could make, you can simply paste in the URL of the video you want to investigate, and the YouTube Money Calculator will show you the results. These will be presented as the number of total video views as well as the estimated earnings for that video based on typical CPM rates, making it a great resource to establish whether to monetize a video or not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100534/7443" target="_top" id="2100534">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100534" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100534/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel"><a href="#2-Estimated-YouTube-Revenue-by-Channel" class="headerlink" title="2.

Your CPM, if you’re new to YouTube and partner advertising, is likely to be quite low, but can be built up over time.</p><p>CPM is actually a term for advertisers rather than content creators, as it denotes the amount an advertiser pays to serve its ad to 1,000 views of a video. What you really want to know is your RPM, or revenue per thousand, which is about how much you’ll get paid for 1,000 views of that ad. In the YouTube world, they call this number eCPM which stands for effective CPM, and if you have access to YouTube analytics, you’ll be able to find it under the estimated monetized playbacks metric.</p><p>If you don’t have YouTube Analytics, you can estimate your eCPM by dividing your most recent earnings by the number of monetized views and then multiplying by 1,000. For example, if you got 10,000 views of a video and earned $30, then your CPM would be $3.</p><p>There are a number of factors that affect what your CPM is, including what category it’s in, what the season is (e.g. Christmas, Halloween), what language you speak, which country you’re from, how much competition there is and much more. As an average, most advertisers are paying in the region of $7.60 per 1,000 impressions, although this can be as high as $15 or as low as $0.10.</p><p>But that’s not the whole story.</p><p>Of course, YouTube needs to make money too, so don’t expect to see all of that $7.60 popped into your AdSense account. Google keeps 45 percent of all YouTube advertising revenue, so you’ll get the other 55 per cent. If you were earning that average $7.60, your actual earnings would be $4.18 per 1,000 views.</p><p>As your subscriber numbers rise and your daily views rise, so will your CPM, so don’t get disheartened if you’ve discovered you’re on $2 or worse. Keep plugging away and building your fan base, and you’ll get there in the end.</p><p>It’s important to realize that, for most new channels, they’ll need to post videos for around two years before they start earning anything significant. If you’re just getting started on YouTube, find your niche and make sure it’s one that advertisers care about. Get it right, and you’ll have a highly targeted audience base which advertisers are willing to pay good money to use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424528">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424528">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424528.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424528%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424528/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Join-the-YouTube-Partner-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform"></a>Part 5: How to Join the YouTube Partner Platform</h2><p>If you’ve had a go with the YouTube money calculator and are excited about the potential to make money from YouTube, the next thing you’ll need to do is to sign up for the partner program. Here’s how:</p><pre><code>     * **Find out if you qualify**: You&#39;ll need to be 18 or over and to have had at least 4,000 views on your channel and 1,000 subscribers in the past 12 months     * **Enable monetization on your account**: Sign in, select &#39;creator studio&#39;, then go to Channel &gt; Status features. Look for the tab for Monetization and click to enable.     * **Agree to the terms**: Once you&#39;ve read and agreed to them, click accept     * **Choose monetizing options**: Pick from overlay in the video, TrueView in-stream ads or video contains product placement. You can always change this later.     * **Confirm enrolment**: Click &#39;monetize my videos&#39; to confirm enrolment</code></pre><p>Once you’ve done all that, YouTube will review your application and decide if you can join the program. Usually, this happens within a matter of seconds, generating confirmation via email.

Choosing A Potential Partner"></a>1. Choosing A Potential Partner</h2><p>Before you think about how you’re going to approach someone you need to decide who you want to approach.</p><p>A lot of people automatically want to approach their YouTube hero, and that can be a mistake. Liking your partner’s videos is a must – why would you want to refer your subscribers to someone whose channel you wouldn’t watch yourself? – but it can be really hard to get someone with a significantly bigger channel than yours to work with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-potential-collab-partner.jpg"                      alt=" Choosing A Potential Partner"                ></p><p><em>Will Kitty get to collab with the big dog?</em></p><p>Larger YouTubers get a lot of collab requests, and they are really busy with their own channels. Even if they love your content, it can be hard to justify taking time away from working on their own channel to do videos that won’t help them grow too.</p><p>Collaborating with someone your own size means you both stand to gain equally in channel growth. Instead of approaching someone you love that’s huge, try finding someone you like just as much whose sub count is similar to yours.</p><p>There are exceptions to this, of course. The team at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDVPcEbVLQgLZX0Rt6jo34A" >Mr.Kate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> managed to work with YouTubers who had millions of subs while they were still under 1 million. They got these high profile collabs because they had something additional to offer that made up for the subscriber gap – they were redesigning the apartments, offices, or studios of the YouTubers they did the collabs with. If you want to work with someone bigger than you, think about what you might be able to offer them in place of new subscribers.</p><p><em>Mr.Kate makes over **<a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAoMPWcQKA%5F9Af5YhWdrZgw?sub_confirmation=1" >MyLifeAsEva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**’s bedroom.</em></p><p>Also, try to find someone whose channel has something in common with yours thematically so you know your subscribers will be interested in them. They don’t have to do exactly what you do, but your topics should be related. For example: if you do quirky video game reviews and they do quirky movie reviews, you could team up to review a movie based on a game. That would make sense. But if you quirky video game reviews and they review do very serious ice cream reviews, that’ll make a lot less sense.</p><p>A good way to find potentially collab partners is to look at your list of subscribers. You already know everyone there likes your channel!</p><h2 id="2-How-to-contact-a-partner"><a href="#2-How-to-contact-a-partner" class="headerlink" title="2. How to contact a partner"></a>2. How to contact a partner</h2><p>Sometimes people leave contact info in their video descriptions, but it might be easier to go to the <strong>About</strong> tab on their channel page and check for an email address. Look for a field that says <strong>for business inquiries</strong>, click on <strong>view email address</strong>, and use the CAPTCHA that appears to prove you aren’t a robot.</p><p>Reaching out more casually through Twitter DMs, YouTube comments, or Facebook is good too, but you should use those platforms more to build a relationship that could lead to a collab. If someone had never commented on a video of yours before and then commented once just to ask you to collab it’d be hard to believe they were really interested in your channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002019/7443" target="_top" id="2002019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002019/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos"><a href="#3-Popular-Types-of-Collab-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Popular Types of Collab Videos"></a>3. Popular Types of Collab Videos</h2><p><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7afFvLLvTiWI97M0jaqgKQ"><strong>Gabrielle</strong></a>talks about different types of collabs and how well they work.</em></p><p>In most cases when you do a collab, you’ll each want to have content to post to your own channels (unless you’re doing some type of interview). You don’t want to put a lot of effort into a video that won’t end up being ‘yours’. Here are a few different ways to collaborate:</p><h4 id="1-Shout-outs"><a href="#1-Shout-outs" class="headerlink" title="#1. Shout outs"></a>#1. Shout outs</h4><p>In this type of collab all you do is mention each other and, usually, use YouTube cards to link to each other’s channels. You make a video that is completely yours, and at some point in it you talk about your partner’s channel and why you like it. To make things fair, you should discuss how long the mentions will be and where in the videos they will happen. It wouldn’t feel good to gush about how great someone is for a full minute near the beginning of your video and have them spend two seconds mentioning you near the end of theirs.</p><p>I personally don’t check people out just because someone I like mentions them, so this might not be the best way to go if you’re hoping to bring in new subscribers. It is the easiest kind of collab to do, though.</p><h4 id="2-Guest-spots"><a href="#2-Guest-spots" class="headerlink" title="2. Guest spots"></a>2. Guest spots</h4><p>This is my favorite kind of collab to watch, because each YouTuber has sole creative control over the video that goes on their channel. Instead of trying to blend your styles together, you each make videos that reflect your own personal styles.</p><p>For your video, you have the other vlogger on as a guest. In the video you do the same kinds of things your fans like watching you do, and you include the other person. If they’re alright with it, it can be fun to draw them a bit outside their comfort zone. If you like to dance on your channel, and they never dance on theirs, ask them to dance with you!</p><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9VX0KXNH20x9MCH3xGjisg" >Matthias <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> gets <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NateWantsToBattle" >NateWantsToBattle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> – who does song parodies on his channel – to make balloon animals.</em></p><p>Turnabout is fair play, of course, so be prepared to step a bit outside of your own comfort zone when you appear as a guest in one of their videos.</p><p>Alternatively, you could just introduce your guest and then let them take over and then do the same thing in reverse on their channel.</p><h4 id="3-Long-distance-collabs"><a href="#3-Long-distance-collabs" class="headerlink" title="3. Long distance collabs"></a>3. Long distance collabs</h4><p><em><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx-S6eBuL9SlwNZTHI6P9Bg" >Lauren <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in Toronto and <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiE7g4J3QXBwPUybbRdioQ" >Aja <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is in LA, but that doesn’t mean they can’t cook together! Also: Lauren’s channel is about food and Aja’s is about healthy living – they aren’t exactly the same, but they’re related enough that the collab makes sense.</em></p><p>Sometimes you really want to work together, but geography just won’t bend to your wills. That doesn’t mean you can’t collab. You can always send each other some footage to cut to and make videos together that way. Or, you can do a Google Hangout or Skype chat and record it.</p><h2 id="4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations"><a href="#4-Getting-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Collaborations" class="headerlink" title="4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"></a>4. Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations</h2><p>Usually, you have two reasons for wanting to do a collab; having fun with another YouTuber, and growing your channel. The collab exposes you to their subscribers, who will hopefully decide they like you and subscribe to you too. There are ways of increasing the odds of this happening.</p><p>Commenting on each other’s videos, and responding to viewer comments, is one of the best. It will help you seem more like a person who is being introduced than a guest star in a video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/getting-most-out-of-collaborations.jpg"                      alt=" Getting the Most Out of Your Collaborations"                ></p><p><em>Kitty got the collab!
