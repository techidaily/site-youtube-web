The product should be related to a topic you know a lot about. This will make your review more credible. It is easier to grow your channel if you focus on a niche (i.e. camera equipment or makeup) you are particularly knowledgeable about.</p><ul><li><a href="#affiliatelinks">Affiliate Links</a></li><li><a href="#freeproducts">Getting Products for Free</a></li><li><a href="#filming">Filming the Video</a></li></ul><h3 id="Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links"><a href="#Part-1-Get-Paid-by-Reviewing-Product-with-Affiliate-Links" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links"></a>Part 1: Get Paid by Reviewing Product with Affiliate Links</h3><p>One of the main ways you can make money doing reviews is through affiliate links. When you join the affiliate program of an online store they will allow you to create special links, called affiliate links, to products listed there. You post these affiliate links in the descriptions of your video reviews and, if viewers choose to click on those links and buy the products, you will earn a sales commission. Here are some stores with great affiliate programs:</p><h4 id="1-JVZoo"><a href="#1-JVZoo" class="headerlink" title="1. JVZoo"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.jvzoo.com/" >JVZoo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>You can find high end products for about $5 to $10. Budgeting will be important if you plan on purchasing products to review instead of only reviewing products you already own (you should try to review items you already have as much as possible).</p><h4 id="2-Click-Bank"><a href="#2-Click-Bank" class="headerlink" title="2. Click Bank"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="http://www.clickbank.com/" >Click Bank <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>You can find a wide range of interesting products here, and you can earn as much as 75% on sales commissions if you provide your viewers with an affiliate link.</p><h4 id="3-Warrior-Plus"><a href="#3-Warrior-Plus" class="headerlink" title="3. Warrior Plus"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://warriorplus.com/" >Warrior Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This is a highly renowned affiliate program. It very similar to JVZoo.</p><h4 id="4-Amazon"><a href="#4-Amazon" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can find just about anything.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free"><a href="#Part-2-Getting-Products-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:  Getting Products for Free"></a>Part 2:  Getting Products for Free</h3><p>Once you’ve built up authority as a reviewer, brands will start giving you free stuff to review. Until then, you can buy the products yourself or review products which you already own. It will be a lot cheaper to review things you already have, or which you were already planning to buy, than to buy products for the purpose of reviewing them. Your reviews will also be more detailed and useful when they are on products you are especially familiar with.</p><p>Once you start building a following, brands will come to you and it will be your choice whether you want to review the things they send you. Until then, try to promote&#x2F;review products you already have opinions on.</p><h3 id="Part-3-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:  Filming the Video"></a>Part 3:  Filming the Video</h3><p>Be completely honest. People are going to know when you are trying to sell something. Fake reviewers are all over the place, and they are easily spotted.</p><p>That does not mean you shouldn’t make money through affiliate links, or accept free products to review. So long as you are honest in your opinions, and open with your viewers about any relationships you have with brands, you are not ‘selling out’.</p><p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>It takes time to earn any money reviewing products on YouTube. However, once you are an established authority in your niche, brands might start coming to you on their own.</p><p>If you were going to be paid to review products on YouTube, what kinds of products would they be? And if you want to make the reviewing video better, you should use a video editing software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943648/22993" target="_top" id="1943648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943648/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130533/26400" target="_top" id="2130533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130533/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vimeo-unveiled-the-premier-video-platform/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Vimeo Unveiled The Premier Video Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-broadcasting-to-the-big-screen-watching-fb-videos-on-tv/"><u>[New] In 2024, Broadcasting to the Big Screen Watching FB Videos on TV?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-the-essence-of-time-stretching-detailed-review-of-slomo-2e1924/"><u>[Updated] The Essence of Time Stretching Detailed Review of SloMo, 2E1924</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-turn-your-youtube-shorts-into-a-stream-of-income-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Turn Your YouTube Shorts Into a Stream of Income for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-video-selfie-mastery-tips-from-top-youtubers/"><u>[Updated] Video Selfie Mastery Tips From Top YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/bypassing-do-not-have-access-error-when-uninstalling-apps/"><u>Bypassing Do Not Have Access Error When Uninstalling Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/critical-runtime-component-missing/"><u>Critical Runtime Component Missing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-dose-life360-notify-me-when-someone-checks-my-location-on-apple-iphone-7-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Dose Life360 Notify Me When Someone Checks My Location On Apple iPhone 7? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-harmony-hub-capture-store-and-review-sounds/"><u>In 2024, Harmony Hub Capture, Store & Review Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/el-the-revenue-riddle-googles-guided-triple-steps-to-youtube-income-analysis/"><u>Unravel the Revenue Riddle Google's Guided Triple Steps to YouTube Income Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/youtube-income-guide-whats-new/"><u>YouTube Income Guide - What's New?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Some YouTubers just love making videos and created their channels so they would have somewhere to post their work. Others have strong opinions they need a platform to share. There are a lot of people on YouTube whose main interest is in a separate website or other social media page, but they use their YouTube channels to help generate traffic.

Go to YouTube.com and look at the top right corner of your screen. There will either be a blue Sign In button, or an icon representing you. YouTube accounts and Google accounts are the same, so if you are signed into your Gmail account you are already signed into YouTube as well.</p><p>2. If you see a Sign In button, click it. If you see your icon click on that, and in the window that pops up select Add Account. Either way, you will be taken into a sign in screen. Under where it asks for your email address it will say Create Account. Click on Create Account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-sign-in-screen.JPG"                      alt="account sign in screen"                ></p><p>3. In the sign up page you will need to put in your name, email address, and mobile phone number as well as some other personal information. Do not enter your current Gmail address. Enter an alternate email you have created for your vlog, or click on I would like a new Gmail address. This will change your page slightly so that the email field becomes Choose a Username.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account new gmail"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/account-after-new-gmail.JPG"                      alt="account after new gmail"                ></p><p>You will probably need to try a few different usernames before you find one that is not taken.</p><p>4. You will have to put in both a first and last name when you create your account, but you can change it to one name later.</p><p>5. Your password will need to be at least 8 characters long. Try to use a combination of letters or numbers, and make sure it is not something easily guessable (i.e spouses name).</p><p>6. After you finish the form click Next Step and, in the next screen, Continue to YouTube.</p><h2 id="Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Tips-on-Starting-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel"></a>Tips on Starting a YouTube Channel</h2><h4 id="1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love"><a href="#1-Choose-a-Topic-you-Love" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose a Topic you Love"></a>1. Choose a Topic you Love</h4><p>When choosing a topic for your YouTube channel make sure you pick something you are passionate about. If you already have an interest or hobby which you are always researching and are extremely up-to-date on then that should probably be the theme of your vlog. If you plan to have a channel where people go to learn anything then you will need to be an authority on that topic. Whatever you make videos about it will need to be something you can realistically see yourself putting a lot of time into. If you cannot think of more than a couple ideas for videos on your topic then that is a sign that you need to choose something else to focus on.</p><p>You should check to see how much demand there is for videos on your topic. This can be done by googling your topic to see what else is out there. If not many people have addressed your topic yet it probably means that it is not something a lot of people want to know about. However, it could also mean that the people who do want to watch videos like yours have been starved for content. Your channel will flop if you do not love what you are making videos about, so do not choose something just because you think it will be popular. Follow your passion.</p><h4 id="2-Check-out-the-Competition"><a href="#2-Check-out-the-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Check out the Competition"></a>2. Check out the Competition</h4><p>You should look for other vlogs with similar topics to yours not only to gauge how much demand there is for your videos, but to check out the competition. If there are a lot of YouTube channels dedicated to the same topic you want to vlog about then this should not discourage you from going after the same viewers. People who are excited about a topic frequently watch more than one vlog about it. It might not even be correct to think of other vloggers within your genre as ‘the competition’ since you are ultimately part of the same community. You will need to watch these people’s videos as part of keeping yourself informed and will likely become a fan – maybe even a collaborator some day – of theirs.</p><p>The main reason you want to look into YouTube channels like yours is because you do not want to be creating content that is overdone and boring. You are tackling the same topic as other people, and may even make some videos on the exact same subjects as others already have. There needs to be something unique about your videos that makes them stand out from what already exists. By looking at what other people are already doing you will be able to come up with ideas for what you can do differently.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-a-Great-Name"><a href="#3-Choose-a-Great-Name" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose a Great Name"></a>3. Choose a Great Name</h4><p>Picking a great name for your YouTube account can take a lot of effort. Chances are you will not want to use your own name, at least not in full. Although your real name can work for if you are a lifestyle vlogger in most cases you will have a more specific topic that will need to be addressed in your channel’s name. Try out your name or a nickname for yourself in combination with different words associated with the topic of your vlog. Aim to create a name that is catchy and easy to remember.</p><p>Chances are a few of your first couple picks will be unavailable. YouTube is a popular site and a lot of the best names are taken. The last thing you should ever do while naming your YouTube channel is add numbers or letters to the end of a name you like because it is taken. Names with numbers at the end are hard for viewers to remember and find again. Choosing a weak name with a trail of numbers or letters after it will make it very hard for your channel to grow. Brainstorm a long list of potential names that are actually good and keep on trying them out until you find one that’s available.</p><p>For more information on naming your YouTube channel read our post ‘How To Pick a Name for Your YouTube Channel’.</p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Schedule"><a href="#4-Make-a-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Schedule"></a>4. Make a Schedule</h4><p>Maintaining a YouTube channel is a big time commitment. You need to post videos regularly or people will forget about you, and videos can take a long time to make. When you are first starting your vlog you should make yourself a schedule for when you want to upload videos. Having a schedule will help you budget your time and ensure that your vlog never gets in the way of the rest of your life.</p><p>Having a posting schedule will also help you grow your channel. Viewers like it when they know when to expect new content from vloggers they like. They are more likely to subscribe and tune in for every post if they are given a chance to anticipate when your new entry is coming.</p><h4 id="5-Take-Inventory"><a href="#5-Take-Inventory" class="headerlink" title="5. Take Inventory"></a>5. Take Inventory</h4><p>Think about what equipment you have that you can use for your YouTube channel. The only thing you absolutely cannot get by without is a decent camera, but there are other types of equipment that it is a good idea to have too. Lights, a tripod, an external microphone – these are all things that a lot of YouTubers find they need in order to produce great videos. If you do not have these things, or money you are prepared to invest in them, then you will need to find ways around them until your situation changes.

While some of the creative tools might be expensive, the easy ones have a steep learning curve, and engaging a professional designer wouldn’t be something you might be ready for. <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is a great solution for any such situation.</p><p>With that being said, the following sections talk about what <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is, how is it useful, what advantages does it offer, and how can you create professional video adverts using the tool.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Get YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Tips for Making Good Video Ads with YouTube Video Builder</a></li></ul><hr><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 1: What Is YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>YouTube recently came up with an online tool, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, that, as the name suggests, enables you as an organization to prepare videos for free. These videos could be anywhere from 6 to 15 seconds long and are most appropriate for advertisements. Once created, the films can be used in the campaigns to promote your brand and&#x2F;or products online.</p><p>However, you must keep the following few things handy before starting with <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> to prepare a video advertisement:</p><ul><li><strong>Logo</strong></li></ul><p>You must have a good-quality photo of your <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >brand logo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that you want to add to the video as a watermark. This gives your organization online recognition.</p><ul><li><strong>HD Images</strong></li></ul><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> only allows you to add still images. The tool compiles these photos using a theme that you select, and enables you to add background music to make the advert more engaging. Therefore, it is imperative to have high-definition images of your product(s) that you want to create a promotional video for.</p><ul><li><strong>Google Chrome Browser</strong></li></ul><p>You must have the latest version of the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer.</p><ul><li><strong>YouTube Channel</strong></li></ul><p>Because <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> will publish your video advertisements on YouTube itself, you must have your own <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Channel created <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, configured, and properly functioning so the posting process remains smooth and seamless.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability of the Tool and Features</strong></li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is still in the Beta phase, and therefore you may not have access to all the features that the tool has to offer. However, this majorly depends on the region of your residence. As of now, the utility is not even available in some countries of the world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-YouTube-Video-Builder-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does YouTube Video Builder Work?</h2><p>As explained earlier, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> is an online tool that works on the latest version of the Google Chrome browser. The web interface of the utility has separate blocks (or placeholders if you want to call them) for different types of images. For instance, there is a placeholder for your logo, and a couple of other blank slots where you can import the photos from your computer.</p><p>There are some text input fields that you can populate with the relevant information such as the name of the video, the product’s name that you wish to promote, and many other things. There is a storyboard at the bottom of the interface that helps give your video a theme and the alignment of the ingredients that you have imported from your computer.</p><p>Finally, you can add background music to the video from the royalty-free tracks that can be accessed from the built-in library, and you are all set to go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-3-How-Can-I-Get-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 3: How Can I Get YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Because YouTube Video Builder is in its Beta phase, at the time of this writing you are required to send an access request to Google using your account that you want to use to create the videos from. You can send your requests to: <a class="link"   href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/" >https://services.google.com/fb/forms/videobuilderbeta/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Once your request is approved, you can then use the same Google account to sign in to the <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> portal, and start preparing your video advertisements. Here, it is important to understand that the Google account that you use to send an access request and prepare the videos must be the same ID that has your active and functional YouTube Channel.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Video-Ads-for-Free-with-YouTube-Video-Builder"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Video-Ads-for-Free-with-YouTube-Video-Builder" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?"></a>Part 4: How to Make Video Ads for Free with YouTube Video Builder?</h2><p>Once you have access to the Beta version of <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, you can start creating the video ads for free. You can learn the process of how this can be done by following the simple instructions given below:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Prepare-a-Console"><a href="#Step-1-Prepare-a-Console" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Prepare a Console"></a>Step 1: Prepare a Console</h4><p>After signing in to your <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> account, on the main interface, click <strong>Select Layout</strong> from the navigation bar at the right if not already selected, pick a layout that best suits your needs, and click <strong>Use Layout</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-layout.jpg"                      alt=" YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><p>Next, from the <strong>Color &amp; Logo</strong> section, choose the base (background) and text colors using their corresponding tools from under the <strong>Brand colors</strong> section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-select-color-logo.jpg"                      alt="Create video with YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After this, insert an image of your brand logo in the block under the <strong>Logos</strong> category.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-brand-logo.jpg"                      alt="Create video with YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-the-Ingredients"><a href="#Step-2-Add-the-Ingredients" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add the Ingredients"></a>Step 2: Add the Ingredients</h4><p>When you are on the <strong>Images &amp; Text</strong> section of the navigation bar, pick the high-definition photos from the <strong>Storyboard</strong> at the bottom, and add them to the <strong>Image 1</strong>, <strong>Image 2</strong>, and <strong>Image 3</strong> boxes accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-builder-insert-images-texts.jpg"                      alt="Create video with YouTube Video Builder "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1557743/17382" target="_top" id="1557743">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1557743" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1557743/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now, scroll down to the <strong>Text</strong> section, and add the relevant content in the available text input fields.

The following few tips would help you achieve this with ease:</p><ul><li>Make sure to gather all the ingredients such as the photos of the products, brand logo, etc. before starting with the video creation process</li><li>Set a layout, font, theme color, and background music that compliments the product(s) you wish to promote</li><li>Remain consistent with the theme color, fonts, etc. throughout the video</li><li>Make sure to include a catchy ‘Call for action’ text in your video ad</li><li>Make as many modifications as you want before publishing the ad on your YouTube Channel. Avoid doing any amendments after the ad has been posted</li><li>Share the link of your video with as many people as you possibly can to make your product(s) and brand visible and popular</li><li>Make sure to use the ad in your campaigns to make people aware of your brand&#x2F;product(s)</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The bitter truth is, producing videos, especially for brand promotions requires expert creators, expensive tools, and a good amount of work experience. Although all these can be managed if you have some spare funds, <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong> helps you create advertising videos of up to 15 seconds with ease and for free. All you need is access to <strong>YouTube Video Builder</strong>, your own YouTube Channel, your brand logo, and high-definition photos of your product(s).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938721/19272" target="_top" id="1938721">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938721" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938721/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-expert-techniques-for-capturing-minute-details-on-video/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Expert Techniques for Capturing Minute Details on Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-transforming-your-videos-with-captivating-youtube-thumbnails-using-a-mac/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Transforming Your Videos with Captivating Youtube Thumbnails, Using a Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-optimizing-content-editing-youtube-descriptions-and-titles-for-growth/"><u>[Updated] Optimizing Content Editing YouTube Descriptions & Titles for Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-concealed-identities-quick-tips-for-face-obscuration-in-images/"><u>2024 Approved Concealed Identities Quick Tips for Face-Obscuration in Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-streamline-your-soundscape-best-free-apps-to-download-youtube-songs-on-android/"><u>2024 Approved Streamline Your Soundscape Best Free Apps to Download YouTube Songs on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-your-monetized-channel-blueprint-for-online-creators/"><u>2024 Approved Your Monetized Channel Blueprint for Online Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fixing-foneazy-mockgo-not-working-on-samsung-galaxy-a05-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Fixing Foneazy MockGo Not Working On Samsung Galaxy A05 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/mastery-in-nullifying-windows-11s-eyes-on-you/"><u>Mastery in Nullifying Windows 11'S Eyes on You</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-converting-webm-files-to-mp3/"><u>New 2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Converting WebM Files to MP3</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/premier-options-to-play-sonys-ps1-games-on-pc-for-2024/"><u>Premier Options to Play Sony's PS1 Games on PC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/top-20-artificial-intelligence-photo-editing-apps-by-movavi/"><u>Top 20 Artificial Intelligence Photo Editing Apps by Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/vivavideo-app-examined-features-and-flaws/"><u>VivaVideo App Examined Features and Flaws</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/why-choosing-the-chatgpt-desktop-experience-is-superior-to-using-the-online-site/"><u>Why Choosing the ChatGPT Desktop Experience Is Superior to Using the Online Site</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

A 24-year-old Salvadoran named Luis Fernando Flores Alvarado is the man behind one of the most subscribed YouTube channels of all time. The Fernanfloo channel was created in 2011, and in February 2014 it had only 100,000 subscribers. By August 2014, Alvarado’s channel reached 1 million subscribers, making him one of YouTube’s biggest success stories. The videos featured on Feranfloo channel mostly cover gaming topics, but with a touch of comedy which makes Alvarado’s videos unique.</p><p>At the end of 2015, Alvarado launched the Fenanfloo mobile app that had 2.3 million downloads in the first week. His videos are mostly in Spanish which somewhat limits his audience, but it is safe to say the Fernanfloo channel is among the most popular channels in the Latin American countries since most of his audience comes from Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.</p><p> For tips on becoming YouTube famous like the creators above, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Looking for a live <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube subscriber chart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027162/19272" target="_top" id="2027162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027162/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Edit-YouTube-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#Edit-YouTube-Videos-with-Full-Featured-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Edit YouTube Videos with Full-Featured Video Editing Software"></a>Edit YouTube Videos with Full-Featured Video Editing Software</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135369/19272" target="_top" id="2135369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135369/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/harting-the-differences-in-youtubes-ownership-and-cc-models/"><u>[New] Charting the Differences in YouTube's Ownership and CC Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-executive-mind-how-neuroscience-can-inform-better-management-strategies/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Executive Mind How Neuroscience Can Inform Better Management Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/se-social-blade-for-youtube-analytics-stats-and-how-to-use-them-for-2024/"><u>[New] Use Social Blade for YouTube Analytics -

The following is a list of the <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>3 best YouTube name generators</strong></a>, an easy step-by-step for <strong>brainstorming</strong>, and instructions for updating your YouTube name.</p><p>Whether you’re a YouTuber beginner or want to improve your YouTube videos to the next level, a good <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be a good helper.

Here are 3 tools for getting started. Even if you don’t use one of the names you generate you’ll get some great inspiration.</p><h4 id="1-SpinXO"><a href="#1-SpinXO" class="headerlink" title="1. SpinXO"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.spinxo.com/youtube-names/" >SpinXO <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> - Lots of options</p><p> - Checks availability</p><p>This is a great generator. If you were brainstorming yourself, you’d probably write out a bunch of words related to yourself and the kinds of videos you want to make and see what goes together. SpinXO does that for you, and mixes in other words that sound good in usernames.</p><p>Here’s what happened when I tried to name a hypothetical baking channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><p>Not all of the results are great, but there are some cool sounding options in there.</p><p>One of the most useful features of SpinXO is that you can check the availability of the usernames. I liked the sound of CupcakesCupola, and when I clicked on it I was able to see that nobody else was using it on other sites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-name-generator-spinxo-2.jpg"                      alt="youtube name generator spinxo"                ></p><h4 id="2-Name-Generator"><a href="#2-Name-Generator" class="headerlink" title="2.

You plunk in a prefix and a suffix, and it generates a random word or term to stuff between them. Here’s what I got for my fictional cupcake channel:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>So, on one hand - that’s hilarious and I’m considering legally changing my name. On the other hand, all of the results look exactly like this (which means they’re all a bit too long). It shows you a longer list if you scroll down:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/namegenerator-biz-example-generated.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Name Generator"                ></p><p>You can pick your favorite names and it’ll list them out so you can easily copy them into a word document. That’ll be useful if you’re collecting options from several sites.</p><h4 id="3-Username-Generator"><a href="#3-Username-Generator" class="headerlink" title="3. Username Generator"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="http://namegenerators.org/username-generator/" >Username Generator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Key points:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong>  Can generate a huge number of names at once</p><p> <strong>-</strong>  You only input one word</p><p>For this name generator, you type in one important word and choose how many results you want to see. You can see up to 300 at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-username-generator.jpg"                      alt="Username Generator"                ></p><p>The generator will take your keyword and add endings (and occasional beginnings) to it.

You may want to use one of the name generators above (anchor) for this part.</p><p>Try to keep your name fairly short (3 words or less) so it’s easier for people to remember. Don’t include numbers if you can avoid it.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Say-it-out-loud"><a href="#Step-3-Say-it-out-loud" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Say it out loud"></a><strong>Step 3: Say it out loud</strong></h4><p>Once you have a shortlist of potential names, read them aloud to yourself to make sure they sound good.

Everyone knows that big YouTubers get paid through the ads that play ahead of their videos. More and more YouTubers keep showing how much money they are making from YouTube via the lifestyles they lead. It begs the question - how much money do YouTubers make?</p><p>One of the main questions is “how many views do you need to start making money on YouTube?” The answer to this question is complicated. You need 4,000 hours of annual viewing time and 1,000 subscribers on your channel to sign up for monetization, but just being able to monetize your videos doesn’t mean you’re going to make money.</p><p>The reason is that YouTubers are not paid per view, they are paid per ad impression.</p><ul><li><a href="#types">Types of YouTube Ads - What is an Ad Impression?</a></li><li><a href="#cpi">CPI Rates Explained</a></li><li><a href="#bigyoutubers">How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</a></li><li><a href="#milestone">Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</a></li></ul><p>Want a fast answer about how much money a YouTuber makes? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out these calculators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression"><a href="#Types-of-YouTube-Ads-–-What-is-an-Ad-Impression" class="headerlink" title="Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?"></a>Types of YouTube Ads – What is an Ad Impression?</h2><p>If you ask YouTubers about how much they make per thousand views, you’ll probably get a different answer depending on the person on who you ask. You may have already heard things like $5 per thousand views or $1,000 per 1 million views, but neither of these is for sure.</p><p>Google’s AdSense service, through which YouTubers make money, pays YouTubers for ad impressions. For most types of ads – including short pre-roll ads, the ads which appear at the bottoms of videos while they play, and the ads which appear as banners to the side of YouTube’s player – an ad impression means someone clicking on the ad and choosing to visit the advertiser’s site. One exception is skippable video ads, for which an impression is created when a viewer watches the ad for 30 seconds.</p><p>YouTubers do not make money on the views of their videos, because not all viewers click on ads. Many viewers bypass ads completely using ad-blockers. The amount of money YouTubers earn from a single ad impression is called their CPI or “cost per impression.”</p><h2 id="CPI-Rates-Explained"><a href="#CPI-Rates-Explained" class="headerlink" title="CPI Rates Explained"></a>CPI Rates Explained</h2><p>YouTube advertising is currently managed inside the AdSense platform. In case you’re not familiar with AdSense, you can have 2 different kinds of ads - the cost per click (CPC) or the cost per view (CPV).</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-Click-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-Click-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per Click ads"></a>Cost Per Click ads</h4><p>The advertiser pays based on how many clicks he was able to get with that particular ad. These kinds of ads usually appear on the right side of your YouTube channel or they can also appear at the bottom of the screen, during the video.</p><h4 id="Cost-Per-View-ads"><a href="#Cost-Per-View-ads" class="headerlink" title="Cost Per View ads"></a>Cost Per View ads</h4><p>the advertiser will pay based on the views he had of the ad and not based on the clicks he was able to generate. One of the things that many people aren’t aware of is the fact that the viewer needs to spend at least 30 seconds watching the ad or half the ad, whichever comes first. This means that a single viewer can continue clicking on the ad multiple times that the advertiser won’t be billed for all those clicks because he is only paying for views.</p><h4 id="Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Never-Click-on-the-CPC-ads-of-Your-Own-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos"></a>Never Click on the CPC ads of Your Own YouTube Videos</h4><p>If any of your friends ever suggest that they are going to do so to help you out tell them not to. AdSense has a rate of ad-clicks that it considers normal and if you get significantly more clicks than that it will think you’re artificially pushing that number up by either clicking yourself or having someone do it for you. If this happens they will ban you from AdSense and, although there is an appeals process, it is unlikely you will ever get your account back and be able to monetize videos again.</p><p>How much you make from an ad on YouTube depends on your CPI, cost per impression. Simply put, this is the rate that YouTube will pay you for every 1,000 views or clicks of the ads that are attached to your videos. Even though it would be a lot simpler if YouTube had their current CPI rates available, they don’t. These rates vary depending on the ad, the types of videos you make, and how popular your channel is. It is actually against YouTube’s rules for YouTubers to share their personal CPI rates publicly.</p><p>Most people tend to assume that CPI rates are between $0.05 and $10. This huge difference is justified by YouTube by saying that they use a very complicated algorithm to determine your CPI rate. According to them, it includes evaluating factors like the ads, the type of audience who views your video, audience engagement, audience retention, and the price of the ads.</p><h2 id="How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-Big-YouTubers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?"></a>How Much Do Big YouTubers Make?</h2><p>Many people are aspiring to make money as famous YouTubers, but it is not an easy task. You have a long way to go before you start making any money at all.</p><p>In general, it’s reasonable to expect to start earning some money when you get to 1 million subscribers. This is the point at which you can start treating YouTube as your job, but the truth is that you will still not be making amazing money. At 1 million subscribers you will only be starting to be seen as someone important in your industry. You won’t even necessarily be “YouTube famous” yet – there are a lot of channels with 1 million subs.</p><p>Even though most people think that YouTube channels with 1 million subscribers are already making a good amount of money and that they are already at the top, the truth is that they’ve just started climbing. They aren’t even near the top. Just to give you a better idea, there are more than 2,400 YouTube channels with more than 1 million subscribers.</p><p>According to Google, when an advertiser pays $100 to Google, Google pays $68 to the publisher (in this case, the publisher is a YouTube creator).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-much-do-youtubers-make.png"                      alt="How Much Do YouTuber Makes"                ></p><p><em>This graphic won’t apply to every situation because every situation is unique. It’s just an example using assumed numbers.</em></p><h4 id="How-much-money-for-1-000-YouTube-views"><a href="#How-much-money-for-1-000-YouTube-views" class="headerlink" title="How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?"></a>How much money for 1,000 YouTube views?</h4><p>15% of 1,000 is 150</p><p>150x CPI ($0.18) &#x3D; $27*</p><p>51% of $27 &#x3D; $13</p><p>Using these rates, 1000 views are worth $13!</p><p>*CPI vary</p><p>Assuming that the average rate is about $0.18 per impression, you still need to factor in that most people don’t click on ads or watch skippable video ads for 30 seconds. Only about 15% of viewers tend to watch the complete ad (or, at least half of it). So, considering that you have 1,000 views on your video, only 150 viewers watched your complete ad. So, at $0.18 per view, Google will charge $27 to the advertiser and the YouTube channel will get 51% of that, meaning the creator will earn $13 per 1,000 views.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Want to know how much YouTube pays for 1 million views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</p><p>It will take you a long time to start earning enough money to support yourself through AdSense. That’s why AdSense isn’t the primary way that huge YouTube stars make money. In addition to AdSense revenue you can (and should) also consider other opportunities such as product placement, endorsements, and brand sponsorships. Many YouTubers also make some money from selling their merchandise.</p><p>Some YouTubers earn millions of dollars every year. Although the exact numbers have never been disclosed, many different websites have made educated guesses.</p><p>Forbes publishes an annual list of the highest-paid YouTubers, which includes revenue from things like book deals and makeup lines. It is useful to look at this list gain have some perspective about how big YouTubers make their money, and how big they had to get to make it.</p><p>As of 2017, YouTube gamer Daniel Middleton (DanTDM) is the highest-paid YouTuber earning 16 million dollars. He is followed by gamer Evan Fong (Vanoss Gaming) with $15.5 million, Dude Perfect with $14 million, and Mark Fischbach (Markiplier) and Logan Paul with $12.5 million. However, as we already mentioned, even though a substantial part of the income of these YouTube stars comes from YouTube&#x2F;AdSense, the bulk of it comes from things like merchandise and sponsorships.</p><p>Instead of relying on YouTube to pay them, YouTubers need to seek out other ways of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >leveraging the YouTube platform to earn money <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>We all agree that being a YouTube star isn’t an easy path. However, if you honestly love what you do, then you will be willing to put effort into making great videos regularly. Part of that is also being willing to take the time to promote them and yourself, as well as putting time and effort into forging a good relationship with your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100527/7443" target="_top" id="2100527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100527/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views"><a href="#Why-No-Longer-10-000-Views" class="headerlink" title="Why No Longer 10,000 Views?"></a>Why No Longer 10,000 Views?</h2><p>YouTube used to let anybody monetize their videos, but that has now changed. Then for a while, you’ll qualify for monetization after reaching 10,000-lifetime views on your channel. But as of 2018, the rules to YouTube monetization has gotten more challenging.</p><p>To monetize you must have:</p><p>- 4,000 of annual watch time</p><p>- 1,000 subscribers</p><p>The reason for this is that YouTube was having trouble with channels that were trying to monetize stolen or inappropriate content, besides, YouTubers are gaming the system by using automated programs to gain more views. By making creators get more watch time and subscribers before they apply for monetization, YouTube has been able to create a review process in which they can prove that the channel has a legitimate audience and stop content thieves and criminals from making money. Naturally, this new rule also makes it very difficult for new YouTubers to make money.</p><p><em>Are you finding it difficult to earn money on YouTube?

If your instance of the web browser is outdated, you may experience a <strong>YouTube TV black screen</strong>.</p><p><strong>Incompatible Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>This mostly happens while using Google Chrome. Because Chrome Web Store is populated with a plethora of extensions, it is likely that any of those might become outdated (or get updated), thus becoming incompatible with the current version of the web browser.</p><p><strong>Slow Internet Connection</strong></p><p>This issue could be from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side. At your part, the maximum you can do is, try switching to a wired network, or if you are using Wi-Fi, consider taking your PC or laptop closer to the wireless router.</p><p><strong>Stale DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Every time you visit a website, its DNS (Domain Name System) record is automatically stored in the DNS cache. This helps in the address resolution process (fetching the URL) the next time you open the site. If the DNS information gets stale in the DNS cache, the browser may fail to locate the website, a YouTube video in this case, and you will be displayed with the black screen.</p><p><strong>Outdated Display Driver</strong></p><p>As it is with Windows itself, even the graphic card driver must be updated regularly to maintain your PC’s health. If an updated version of the display driver is not installed on your Windows computer, you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-YouTube-Video-Black-Screen-Quick-Way" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]"></a>Part 2: How to Fix YouTube Video Black Screen [*Quick Way]</h2><p>Depending on the root cause of the issue, the solutions to fix the <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong> issue may differ.

Web Browser Solution(s)"></a>1. Web Browser Solution(s)</h3><p><strong>Solution 1: Update Your Web Browser</strong></p><p>When you experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, try updating your web browser to its latest version. Assuming that you’re using Google Chrome, the update process is given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome, click the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> icon from the top-right corner, and then select <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> from the menu that appears.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If the <strong>Update Google Chrome</strong> option isn’t available, it simply means that you are already using the latest version of the browser</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Restart the Web Browser</strong></p><p>If the video isn’t visible even after updating Google Chrome, or if you’re already using the most recent version but the issue is still there, you can close the web browser, and relaunch it to see if that helps.</p><p><strong>Solution 3: Use a Different Browser</strong></p><p>If Google Chrome itself is the culprit, the video should be visible on a different browser. You may consider using Mozilla Firefox or the Windows’ default app, Microsoft Edge.</p><p>Copy the URL of the faulty video from Google Chrome’s address bar, and then launch a different web browser, and paste the copied URL in the new browser’s address bar. Press <strong>Enter</strong> and see if the video plays correctly.</p><p><strong>Solution 4: Clean the Web Browser</strong></p><p>Sometimes even the web browser history and caches can also prevent a YouTube video from being displayed. Therefore, it would be a good idea to clear the browser data, and see if it helps. The process is given below:</p><p>After launching the web browser (Google Chrome is used here for example), go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, and then go to <strong>More tools</strong>, and then select <strong>Clear browsing data</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-google-chrome-cache.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome cache"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129042/19576" target="_top" id="2129042">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129042" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129042/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Switch between the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> tabs on the <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> box to choose the records that you want to delete, and then choose your preferred duration of the records from the <strong>Time range</strong> drop-down list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clear-browsing-data-chrome.jpg"                      alt="clear google chrome browsing data"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Clear data</strong> from the bottom-right corner to clear browsing caches.</p><p><strong>Solution 5: Disable&#x2F;Remove the Extensions</strong></p><p>If one or more browser extensions are incompatible, even then you may experience <strong>YouTube black screen</strong>. In such a case, you can disable those extensions, or permanently remove them to resolve the issue. You can learn the process of doing so by following the instructions that are given below:</p><p>Launch Google Chrome and go to the <strong>Customize and control Google Chrome</strong> menu, go to <strong>More tools,</strong> then select <strong>Extensions</strong> from the submenu that appears.</p><p>Turn off the switch for each of the installed extensions to check if the issue is fixed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/disable-google-chrome-extensions.jpg"                      alt="disable google chrome extension"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If this solution works, you can try enabling the extensions one at a time, and check turning on which one causes <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>. Once the culprit extension is found, you can click <strong>Remove</strong> to get rid of it altogether.</p><p><strong>Solution 6: Reinstall the Browser</strong></p><p>If the video is visible on a different web browser, probably the default one that you are using got corrupted. A quick resolution would be to remove its instance from your PC, and install a fresh copy. To do so:</p><p>• Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the results list.</p><p>• On the <strong>Control Panel</strong> window, click <strong>Uninstall a program</strong> from under the <strong>Programs</strong></p><p>• Click to select the browser from the list of installed apps (Google Chrome here) and select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from above the list.</p><p>• Follow the on-screen instructions from there to remove the web browser from your PC. Next, use Microsoft Edge (or any other browser) to download and install a fresh copy of Google Chrome and see if the issue is fixed</p><h3 id="2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s"><a href="#2-ISP-or-Internet-Speed-Solution-s" class="headerlink" title="2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)"></a>2. ISP or Internet Speed Solution(s)</h3><p>If you are experiencing a slow Internet connection, the issue might be either from your Internet Service Provider’s (ISP’s) side, or on your part. In any case, you can try the following solutions to fix the issue:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Get Your PC&#x2F;Laptop Closer to the Router</strong></p><p>If you are using a Wi-Fi network, consider bringing your device a bit closer to the wireless router and see if the issue is fixed. You may also want to recheck and ensure that there are no highly magnetic devices (a speaker or something similar) placed near the router.</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Switch to a Wired Network</strong></p><p>If the problem persists, try connecting your laptop&#x2F;desktop PC to your router with a LAN cable, and then try reopening the YouTube video to see if it plays correctly this time.</p><p><strong>PC&#x2F;Windows Solution(s)</strong></p><p>At times, your computer could be the main culprit, and trying some basic troubleshooting steps might resolve the issue. Some of the most effective solutions are listed below:</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Clear DNS Cache</strong></p><p>Clearing the DNS cache ensures that your PC is now ready to accept and save new DNS records in the cache. The process of clearing the existing cache data is listed below:</p><p>Type <strong>CMD</strong> in the <strong>Cortana</strong> search box, and click <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the right menu of the results list.</p><p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> on the <strong>User Account Control</strong> confirmation box, and in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window, type <strong>IPCONFIG &#x2F;FLUSHDNS</strong> and press Enter</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-command-to-fix-youtube-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="use command to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Try opening the YouTube video again and see if the issue is fixed</p><p><strong>Solution 2: Update the Graphic Card Driver</strong></p><p>Anything that you see on your computer screen is because of the graphics card. Since a driver is needed to interact with the device, an old one might prevent the videos from getting displayed. If the graphics card is the culprit, the chances are that you won’t be able to see any video at all, be it from YouTube or offline. Therefore, checking if you are using the latest version of the graphic card driver wouldn’t harm you. The process is given below:</p><p>Right-click <strong>Start</strong> and go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the context menu</p><p>Expand the <strong>Display adapters</strong> tree on the <strong>Device Manager</strong> snap-in, and right-click the graphics card from the list and select <strong>Update driver</strong> from the context menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upgrade-graphic-card-to-fix-youtube-video-black-screen.jpg"                      alt="upgrade graphic card to fix YouTube black screen"                ></p><p>Click <strong>Search automatically for drivers</strong> from the next screen that appears and follow the on-screen instructions from there to update the graphic card driver.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If your PC has multiple graphic cards installed in it, you will have to follow this procedure for each of them individually.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918666/19272" target="_top" id="1918666">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918666" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918666/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Troubleshoot-YouTube-Black-Screen-on-Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?"></a>Part 3: How to Troubleshoot YouTube Black Screen on Mobile?</h2><p>If you wish to watch online videos on your smartphone, but experience <strong>YouTube video black screen</strong>, the process of fixing the issue on the phones is comparatively simple.

There are three different Creative Commons licenses uses on Freesound and which one applies to the sound effect you want depends on the user who posted it.</p><p>The three licenses used on Freesound are <strong>Zero</strong>, <strong>Attribution</strong>, and <strong>Attribution-Noncommercial.</strong></p><p><strong>Zero (cc0)</strong>: you can do anything you want with these sound effects except claim that you created them. You can make money off of them and you do not have to credit the original creator.</p><p><strong>Attribution (by)</strong>: you should credit the creator of the sound. Usually, this means adding a ‘Sound effect by Username on Freesound’ line in the description of your video. So long as you credit the artists you can do anything with these sounds, even monetize the videos you use them in.</p><p><strong>Attribution-Noncommercial (by –nc)</strong>: you must credit the creators of these sound effects and you cannot make money off of them. This means that you cannot monetize a video in which you used these sound effects.</p><p>Freesound is a social site where you can talk to the creators of the sounds you want to download. If you are planning to monetize a video that uses an Attribution-Noncommercial sound effect you can always ask the artist for permission.</p><p>I’ve also found a YouTube video that explains the Creative Commons in detail.

Sound effects costing more than $10 tend to either be longer or include whole sets of sounds. You can filter the sounds on AudioJungle by category, tags, and price while you browse.</p><p>There are two different licenses you can purchase on AudioJungle, SFX Single Use, and SFX Multi-Use. The prices displayed are all for the Single Use license. The Multi-Use license costs more.</p><p>The main difference between the two licenses on AudioJungle is how many projects you can use your sound effect in. If you purchase a sound under a Single-Use license you can only use it in one project. You can use it as many times as you want within that project, and you can even make money off of that project, but you cannot use it again in a second project unless you repurchase it. While it is more expensive, the Multi-Use license gives you unlimited use of your download.</p><p>If you decide to use sound effects from any of these sites then please make sure to read their more detailed legal information.</p><h3 id="4-Free-Sound-Effects"><a href="#4-Free-Sound-Effects" class="headerlink" title="4.Free Sound Effects"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://www.freesoundeffects.com/free-sounds/airplane-10004/" >Free Sound Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Free-Sound-Effects.JPG"                      alt="Free Sound Effects"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135351/19272" target="_top" id="2135351">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135351" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135351/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The Free Sound Effects lets you access free as well as licensed sound effects.

Dailymotion gives you a golden opportunity and platform to share your videos on websites other than YouTube. This means that you can transfer your videos from YouTube to dailymotion in few minutes and increase the audience. There is no direct transfer feature in YouTube and hence this post will help in guiding how can you transfer the video content from YouTube to Dailymotion!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Download YouTube video and upload to Dailymotion</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion</a></li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads.

All you have to do is to login to your YouTube official account and download all the videos that you have uploaded in MP4 format by clicking on Edit option appearing at right of the video.</p><p>Ready to learn <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download YouTube Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It’s easy, fun and a great way to share your movies with the world.</p><p>Save it to the desired folder on your PC and navigate to the Dailymotion account page. Sign in with your credentials and click on upload video. Browse the video from the location where you saved, give it a title and description.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dailymotion-uploading.jpg"                      alt="dailymotion-uploading"                ></p><p>Next, click on channel drop-down menu and choose a category which best describes your video. Besides this, you would see a ‘Tags’ text box. You can add one or more tags (maximum 10) and select the privacy options as per your requirement. Tags act as a criterion for SEO optimization and help people in finding your video. Finally, just click on save to upload the video on dailymotion.</p><h2 id="Method-2-Sync-YouTube-videos-to-Dailymotion"><a href="#Method-2-Sync-YouTube-videos-to-Dailymotion" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion"></a>Method 2: Sync YouTube videos to Dailymotion</h2><p>You can do this by liaising with Freedom MCN Network as it allows you to grow faster on Dailymotion. All you have to do is to search for ‘dashboard.tm’ on Google and sign in using you email and password. It will direct you to Dailymotion page; you can also opt to sign in with your Facebook credentials. When you will press enter and login, the first screen only will show the prompt if you want to synch YouTube and Dailymotion channels? Since, our answer is yes, the screen will ask you to login into your YouTube account and the screen will navigate you to the login into Google account linked to your YouTube account. Just like in all apps, you have to allow Freedom to access the data from your YouTube account. The next screen will list down number of videos that have been uploaded to your YouTube Account and the ones which are already synched with Dailymotion will have a check against their name. The ones which are not synched will have a box; you can simply check it and click on ‘Synch videos’ at the top right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-dailymotion-video.jpg"                      alt=" Sync Dailymotion video"                ></p><p>It will ask for your email address to get notifications, put in your email ID and click on Sync. Once they are active and synched you will receive a notification on your email with a subject ‘Done reuploading’ followed by the tile of the video. This simply means that you need not upload any video separately on dailymotion, you can simply synch it with YouTube and put in your efforts of uploading only once!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/iscover-the-best-in-class-our-list-of-12-high-performing-flip-cameras/"><u>[New] Discover the Best in Class Our List of 12 High-Performing Flip Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-boost-production-value-with-free-sfx-libraries/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Boost Production Value with Free SFX Libraries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-maximize-your-seo-top-7-budget-friendly-youtube-tags-extractors-reviewed/"><u>2024 Approved Maximize Your SEO Top 7 Budget-Friendly Youtube Tags Extractors Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-microcinema-plot-pointers/"><u>2024 Approved Microcinema Plot Pointers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/exclusive-overlooked-the-creme-de-la-creme-mac-transcribers-for-2024/"><u>Exclusive, Overlooked The Crème De La Crème Mac Transcribers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/get-the-best-lap-times-with-logitech-g27-drivers-and-setup-for-windows-11-10-and-7/"><u>Get the Best Lap Times with Logitech G27: Drivers and Setup for Windows 11, 10 & 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-the-security-questions-of-your-apple-id-from-your-iphone-13-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Reset the Security Questions of Your Apple ID From Your iPhone 13 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/raphic-review-fifa-video-gains-on-social-platforms-for-2024/"><u>Infographic Review FIFA Video Gains on Social Platforms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/optimized-with-advanced-data-tracking-cookiebot-integration/"><u>Optimized with Advanced Data Tracking: Cookiebot Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/turning-off-two-factor-authentication-from-apple-iphone-se-2022-5-tips-you-must-know-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Turning Off Two Factor Authentication From Apple iPhone SE (2022)? 5 Tips You Must Know</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144309/7443" target="_top" id="2144309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144309/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

There is a fantastic quote, credited to bestselling author, <a class="link"   href="https://acuff.me/" >Jon Acuff <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that goes:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fantastic-quote-do-not-compare-beginning-to-middle.jpg"                      alt="fantastic quote"                ></p><p>While researching your competition, you will feel overwhelmed, but remember, you are at the beginning, and Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver are not even at their middle, they are way passed the finish line. You still have a long journey to go, so don’t get discouraged, get inspired!</p><p>Watch those videos and understand what they are all about.</p><p>Understand that people watch YouTube for 3 key reasons:</p><p>- To be entertained</p><p>- To learn something new</p><p>- To be inspired</p><p>A video that can hit all 3 marks is going to be positioned for success. Don’t fret too much about the competition, as long as your content is good, you will see improvement.</p><p>So if you think this scrambled egg idea can hit those 3 marks, then I encourage you to go to the next step. If you don’t, let’s regroup and brainstorm some more <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube video ideas <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-Keywords"><a href="#Step-2-Find-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find Keywords"></a>Step 2: Find Keywords</h4><p>Now that we’ve decided that we are sticking with the video idea, we are ready to do some keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases people type in the YouTube search bar to discover videos.</p><p>Come up with as many relevant keywords as you can. Start by entering a keyword into the YouTube search bar. This will tell you what are the most popular searches associated with that keyword:</p><p>Once you have an idea of what people are searching for related to your topic, you’ll want to find more relevant keywords. I like to use the free app, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to do that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-seo-tool-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt="Find Keywords with Ubersuggest"                ></p><p>This app gives you a whole list of long-tail keywords, which are 3-4-word phrases which is specific to what your video is about.</p><p>Some you will use to dig deeper in and other you will deem irrelevant to your videos. A good way of determining the value of a keyword is by the stats the application shows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-keywords-with-ubersuggest.jpg"                      alt=" Keywords in Ubersuggest"                ></p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions"><a href="#How-to-Read-Keyword-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="How to Read Keyword Suggestions"></a>How to Read Keyword Suggestions</h4><p>Once you have a list of keywords, you will see some numbers on the right-hand side. Here is what each one is about:</p><p><strong>- Search volume</strong> is the number used to identify the popularity of the keyword. The higher the number the more people are searching for it.</p><p><strong>- CPC</strong> is the value accredited by YouTube, determining how much advertisers are paying to target audiences who search for that keyword and click on the link.</p><p><strong>- Competition</strong> is the number used to qualify how many other content are using that keyword.</p><p>The two categories that matter most to us right now is Search Volume and Competition. We want keywords with high search volume and low competition rate.</p><p>In the example above, you can see that the keyword “<strong>avocado scrambled eggs</strong>” has a Search Volume of <strong>1,000</strong> and a competition rate of <strong>0.0</strong>. This is a good keyword to target, if you can incorporate an avocado to your dish… which of course you can!</p><h4 id="Step-3-Write-Title"><a href="#Step-3-Write-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Write Title"></a>Step 3: Write Title</h4><p>I know you might want to deal with the Title, Description, and Tags after you’ve filmed and edited your video. But if you want to apply a YouTube SEO-focused strategy, then these should be addressed before you even pick up a camera as it can greatly dictate the content you end up creating.</p><p>A good YouTube title sparks curiosity, evokes emotional reaction, and promises value to your viewers.</p><p>Of course you can title your video simply: <strong>Making Scrambled Eggs</strong></p><p>But does it spark curiosity? Not really… most people can make scrambled eggs.</p><p>Does it evoke any emotion? Maybe hunger… but even then, not really…</p><p>Finally, does it promise value? Well, assuming that most people can at least crack an egg into a pan, then hardly.</p><p>Your scrambled egg is special! Your video is special! We need to evoke that in the title — and as long as you are not writing any clickbait and deliver on what the title suggest, you can do this.</p><p>So, how about this: <strong>Are My Amazing Scrambled Eggs Better Than Gordon Ramsay’s?</strong></p><p>Hmmm… Well, is it? We know that the Gordon Ramsay’s video has almost 30M views. Many people have already tried cooking it, I’m sure. There is only one way to find out, by encouraging others to try it over Gordon’s.</p><p>You don’t need to go for a somewhat contentious title like this, but that’s the idea, you want something that gets people curious, make them feel a certain way, and in the end, make them better for having watched your video.</p><p>See how a good title can guide the rest of your video?</p><h4 id="Step-4-Write-Description"><a href="#Step-4-Write-Description" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Write Description"></a>Step 4: Write Description</h4><p>You aren’t going to be writing the description for the viewers necessarily, you are going to be writing it for YouTube’s algorithms. The better YouTube understands what your video is about, the better they can show it to people searching for it.</p><p>This means you need to include the keywords you were researching at the beginning of your description, as YouTube will be using them to identify the content of your video. 1 or 2 keywords that best represent your video is enough. Don’t stuff the title with too many keywords or you’ll risk sounding like a robot.</p><p>But also use the description for practical uses too, if you have additional information such as supportive links, outline of the video’s content, a list of materials, step-by-step guide, or a recipe that you think your human viewers will find useful, you should input that in the description as well.</p><h4 id="Step-5-Write-Tags"><a href="#Step-5-Write-Tags" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Write Tags"></a>Step 5: Write Tags</h4><p>Thank goodness we did the keyword research in Step 2, because coming up with tags is not as easy as it looks.</p><p>Pull 15 keywords from the list and keep it somewhere safe.</p><p>Note: The keywords you used in the title should be found in your tags, and since they are the most important ones, you should place them first.</p><p>Organize your keywords in the tag as such:</p><p>Have the specific keywords at the top, followed by more general keywords, and then branded ones:</p><p><strong>Specific</strong>: How to make scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>General</strong>: Scrambled eggs</p><p><strong>Branded</strong>: Gordon Ramsay scrambled eggs</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible"><a href="#Part-2-Make-The-Best-Darn-Video-Possible" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible"></a>Part 2: Make The Best Darn Video Possible</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how relevant your keywords are or how epic your title is, if you video sucks (i.e. your viewers click in and leave right away), YouTube will not show it in search.</p><p>Even if you haven’t created any videos yet, you can follow these next steps to ensure you are following the best practices to structure your video.</p><h4 id="Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook"><a href="#Step-6-Plan-and-Film-the-Hook" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook"></a>Step 6: Plan and Film the Hook</h4><p>The first few seconds is where the largest percentage of your earned viewership will drop off. Odds are <a class="link"   href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/marketing-online-video-viewers-quit-30-seconds/146218/" >20% of your viewers won’t even get past the first 10 seconds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>What you need is a hook, an intro that ensures this video is what they want to watch and let’s them know what they can expect.</p><h4 id="Step-7-Film-B-Roll"><a href="#Step-7-Film-B-Roll" class="headerlink" title="Step 7: Film B-Roll"></a>Step 7: Film B-Roll</h4><p>One static camera shot of you talking or cooking or giving a tutorial can cause your viewers to lose attention.</p><p>In order to keep your viewers interest, you will need b-roll, or supplemental footage you can cut to give you video more life.</p><p>While jump cuts (cuts made on a sequential clip of the same subject or in the same camera position) are fine, having additional footage to cut to will make your video feel more fluid.</p><p>So when you are filming your scrambled egg video, make sure you get some footage of you cracking the egg, scrambling it, and serving it on the plate.</p><h4 id="Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video"><a href="#Step-8-Encourage-Viewers-to-Engage-in-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"></a>Step 8: Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video</h4><p>Liking, disliking, subscribing, and commenting on your video will all help your performance indirectly.</p><p>While YouTube wouldn’t rank your video higher simply because you have more likes subscribers, or comments, engagement from viewers help your video get discovered. If you get a like or comment from a YouTuber with a lot of subscribers, your video may be visible to those who are following that YouTuber for a while.</p><p>The best way to get engagement from your audience is to encourage them to like and subscribe or ask them a question or start a dialogue.</p><p>For example, in this scrambled egg video you are making, at the end you can ask, “So what do you think, is this better than Gordon Ramsay?”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/encourage-viewers-to-engage-min.gif"                      alt="Encourage Viewers to Engage in Video"                ></p><p>Who knows, who will respond.</p><h4 id="Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail"><a href="#Step-9-Design-a-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="Step 9: Design a Thumbnail"></a>Step 9: Design a Thumbnail</h4><p>You could have made a brilliant video, but if you have a poor quality thumbnail that is unattractive, then the overall performance of your video will suffer — and good SEO can only do so much after that.</p><p>Your viewers will absolutely judge your video by its cover so it’s important to put some thought into it and not solely rely on the three random thumbnail choices that YouTube picks for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/design-youtube-video-thumbnail.jpg"                      alt="Design a Thumbnail"                ></p><p>Take a look at your competition. If they all look the same, do something different. Add text or a human face (preferably yours) to evoke emotion, as viewers are more likely to click into a video if they see an expressive image.</p><p>Don’t want to pay money for a photo editing software such as Photoshop?</p><p>You can use an online service called <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or download <a class="link"   href="https://www.gimp.org/" >GIMP <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, an open-source photo editor much like Photoshop, but far less powerful. These will help you get the job done as you are starting out.</p><p>Want to know more thumbnail maker?

This step is easy, upload the video, and fill out the assets, and give yourself a pat on the back.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creator-stuido-fill-out-video-assets.jpg"                      alt="Fill Out Your Videos Assets"                ></p><h4 id="Step-11-Add-Transcripts"><a href="#Step-11-Add-Transcripts" class="headerlink" title="Step 11: Add Transcripts"></a>Step 11: Add Transcripts</h4><p>In addition to making your content accessible for people who don’t want to or can’t listen to the audio in your video, adding subtitles and closed captions will help YouTube understand the spoken content in your video.</p><p>While YouTube does have an automatic subtitle generator, it’s not reliable enough to be used for identifying the keywords you use in your video.</p><p>You can choose to write out the whole transcript of your video yourself, but if you are press on time, which of course you are, you can simply go and edit the automatic transcript already available in your video. By the way, you can also use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >automatic transcription software. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist"><a href="#Step-12-Add-Video-to-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="Step 12: Add Video to Playlist"></a>Step 12: Add Video to Playlist</h4><p>Finally the last thing you need to do for your video is to add it to a playlist. Even though it might be the first video in the playlist, it helps YouTube identify your video if you organize it in a playlist. As you accumulate more content, having videos in playlists makes content easier to find and keeps relevant videos together.</p><p>When viewers searches, having your videos in playlists increases the chance of it being discovered.</p><p>So if your first video is about scrambled eggs, maybe you next video can be about the awesome butter toasts.</p><p>I guess, you are on your way to making a pretty badass breakfast playlist. I personally can’t wait to see it!</p><p>If you treat SEO as an afterthought, only after your video is created, you are not using it to its full potential. If you follow these 12 steps during the course of your production, you will find that SEO doesn’t simply help your video perform at the end, but contributes in all the other phases of creating your video as well.</p><p>Besides considering YouTube SEO, you should make a good YouTube video as well.
