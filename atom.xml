It is even more important than your view count. Your view count really only tells you how many people are finding and clicking on your videos, not whether they are actually watching them. Audience retention refers to how much of a video a viewer watches before clicking away, which is very useful information to have. If you know when people are leaving your videos then you know what you need to work on.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to analyse your and your competitors’ YouTube Channel &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to structure a YouTube video &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Audience Retention?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: What is a Good Audience Retention Rate on YouTube?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Audience-Retention"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Audience Retention?"></a>Part 1: What is Audience Retention?</h2><p>To put it in simple terms, YouTube audience retention is about how much of each video your viewers watch. It’s usually expressed as a percentage, so if your viewer gets half way through, they will have a retention of 50 per cent.</p><p>For YouTube analytics, audience retention is taken as a mean of the retention figures for each of your viewers. For example, if you post a ten-minute video and half your viewers get to the five-minute mark, that’s a retention of 50 per cent. If the other half watch it right to the end, that’s a retention of 100 per cent. The mean of these two figures is 75 per cent, and that’s what YouTube will use as your audience retention figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-analytics-audience-retention.jpg"                                     ></p><p>This retention rate affects how highly your video is ranked on YouTube, with videos boasting higher audience retention rates appearing higher in the search results than those which do not. This is because both YouTube and Google are highly focussed on customer satisfaction, and a long watch time means a very happy customer was watching that video. For this reason, it’s well worth considering how to increase YouTube audience retention as it demonstrates that you’re making great content as well as helping you get more viewers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484909/16446" target="_top" id="1484909">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484909" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484909/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-See-Your-Audience-Retention-Report-in-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-See-Your-Audience-Retention-Report-in-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?"></a>Part 2: How to See Your Audience Retention Report in YouTube?</h2><p>YouTube will produce reports to help you keep track of your audience retention. There are two types of audience retention reports; absolute and relative. Absolute allows you to view a graph of your video’s retention and see when people might be clicking away, or if they are skipping to later parts of your video. If you lose a lot of viewers in the first 15 seconds of your videos then that is a clear indication that your content is not what the viewers who find your videos really want. The relative report is where your video is compared to the average retention of similar videos.</p><p>Note that by ‘similar videos’, YouTube means videos of a similar length. There is no way to compare your videos only to other videos in your genre. The relative report will always be somewhat skewed because your videos will be measured against very different content.</p><p>To see an audience retention report log into your YouTube account and go to your<strong>Creator Studio</strong>. There, select<strong>Audience Retention</strong>under<strong>Analytics</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audience-retention.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770544">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770544">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770544%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770544/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="701707">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-701707">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/701707.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fappsumo.8odi.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F701707%2F7443'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/701707/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Good-Audience-Retention-Rate-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Good-Audience-Retention-Rate-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Good Audience Retention Rate on YouTube?"></a>Part 3: What is a Good Audience Retention Rate on YouTube?</h2><p>When you’re considering how to increase YouTube audience retention, it can be good to have a goal in mind. Obviously 100 per cent is going to be the Holy Grail of retention rates, but how many videos are actually going to achieve that? It only takes for one person to ‘accidentally’ click on your video and rapidly click away, or for someone to have to stop for outside reasons, to drag your average down.</p><p>According to the YouTube community, a good goal to aim for is around 50 per cent, but as there is a lot which can affect your retention rate, that number may be different for you. Low view numbers sometimes get higher retention rates because it’s mainly subscribers watching, whereas channels with millions of views may suffer due to more people abandoning. Rather than setting yourself a golden number, focus instead on increasing your retention rate from wherever it is now, and celebrate your own success instead of measuring yourself against others.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention"><a href="#Part-4-6-Ways-to-Increase-YouTube-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention"></a>Part 4: 6 Ways to Increase YouTube Audience Retention</h2><p>If you’re serious about learning how to increase YouTube audience retention, here are five of the best ideas for you:</p><h4 id="1-Compare-your-videos"><a href="#1-Compare-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Compare your videos"></a>1. Compare your videos</h4><p>Investigating your audience retention report will highlight the videos where you achieved maximum success. Think about what you did here, and work to replicate that technique. Perhaps you were talking about a product, or maybe your structured your video slightly differently. It’s up to you to dissect your video and find out what it was that kept people watching for longer, so that you can repeat this success in the future. You can also use some influencer marketing platform such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.influenex.com/" >InflueNex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to take a look at the videos in your similar channels, and learn the popular videos on their channels.</p><h4 id="2-Get-on-with-it"><a href="#2-Get-on-with-it" class="headerlink" title="2. Get on with it"></a>2. Get on with it</h4><p>Research shows that YouTube viewers have an incredibly short attention span. Depending on who you believe, you could have as much as six seconds or as little as just three to grab their attention and compel them to carry on watching. If you want to improve your audience retention, coming in with an engaging, attention grabbing statement right at the start is crucial to your success. Nobody wants to waste their time watching someone waffle on for ages about their granny or their favorite hobbies, so get right down to it straight away, by telling them what’s in store.</p><h4 id="3-Make-it-visually-engaging"><a href="#3-Make-it-visually-engaging" class="headerlink" title="3. Make it visually engaging"></a>3. Make it visually engaging</h4><p>Perhaps all you’ve got is a presentation to make. You’re not a gamer, you’re not showing clips of your cat and you’re not doing a makeup tutorial, so surely all you need is a camera, good lighting and your face, right? Wrong. Viewers like to see the visual content changing, and videos which have a range of scenes are usually far more successful than those where it’s just a person talking to camera. Think about how you can insert cutaways, pop up text, different footage and other graphics to keep it interesting for your viewers.</p><h4 id="4-Make-it-shorter"><a href="#4-Make-it-shorter" class="headerlink" title="4. Make it shorter"></a>4. Make it shorter</h4><p>This one is a no brainer really. If you make a one-minute video, how hard is it going to be to keep viewers watching to the end compared to a 20-minute marathon. However, going too short can be negative too, unless you really do have something very quick and simple to showcase. Long videos work well for YouTubers in the gaming niche, in particular, because viewers want to know the end result, but for most of us, these sorts of viewing statistics are hard to reach.</p><p>If you consider a viewer who watches three minutes of your content, would you rather they watched three minutes of a ten-minute video and then clicked away bored, or would you rather they finished an entire video that was only three minutes long? Both in terms of audience retention and of your own reputation, having a viewer finish a short video is much more valuable to you than losing someone half way through a long one. That person probably enjoyed your content to the end and will more than likely watch another one of your videos. Conversely, the one you lost half way through was bored enough to stop watching and will probably not bother viewing any other videos of yours in future.</p><h4 id="5-Keep-them-hooked"><a href="#5-Keep-them-hooked" class="headerlink" title="5. Keep them hooked"></a>5. Keep them hooked</h4><p>Think carefully about your YouTube video structure. Ideally, you will tell them at the very start that you’ve got something amazing to share with them later on. This could be a tip, a tutorial, a new product reveal or even something funny. Whatever it is, tell them they’re going to love it from the start, and keep reminding them to watch from the end to get this gift. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t give them great content all the way through, just that you should save a carrot for the end of the ride to reward those loyal viewers.</p><p>So, now you know how to increase YouTube audience retention, what are you going to do about it? Have a go at modifying your videos to boost the numbers who will watch to the end and let us know how you got on.</p><h4 id="6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor"><a href="#6-Use-an-Excellent-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="6. Use an Excellent Video Editor"></a>6. Use an Excellent Video Editor</h4><p>Content is the king. It is necessary to use a powerful video editor to help you edit videos.

People will watch your vlog because they want to hear what you are saying. It can be tempting to use the audio your camera records rather than buy a separate microphone. Unfortunately, the microphones built into most cameras will only record mediocre audio. In this case, we have researched and found out the following best microphones for YouTube videos based on its price and performance. Besides, we will also highlight the best microphones for different recording scenarios. Whether you’re making gaming videos or recording yourself singing, or filming inside or outside, you will get to know which one is best for your situation.

It will record your audio simultaneously while you are using your webcam. The biggest drawback of the Snowball is that it needs to be close to you while your record. This combined with its larger size means that it will probably need to be in your shot.</p><h4 id="2-RODE-Video-Shotgun-Mic-140"><a href="#2-RODE-Video-Shotgun-Mic-140" class="headerlink" title="2.

To work well it needs to be pointing at the person who is speaking, and it should be fairly close to them as well.

If you are working alone then you can set this mic up on a stand so it is pointing at you, or if you have a friend to help you you can ask them to hold it on a boom pole.</p><h4 id="4-Sony-LAV-Wireless-Mic-System-600"><a href="#4-Sony-LAV-Wireless-Mic-System-600" class="headerlink" title="4.

Connecting directly to your computer via USB, the Blue Yeti comes with a 6-feet long USB cable. Out of the box, it sits upon a sturdy stand, which can be removed and the mic can be threaded a shock mount.</p><p>The Blue Yeti can pick up audio in four different polar patterns: cardioid, bidirectional, omnidirectional, and stereo. This makes it incredibly versatile, but if you are streaming, I recommend keeping it on cardioid.</p><p>Tip: In cardioid mode, speak into the front of the mic, not the top of it.</p><h3 id="2-Best-Microphones-for-Outdoor-Locations"><a href="#2-Best-Microphones-for-Outdoor-Locations" class="headerlink" title="2.

If that’s the case, film the source of the background noise. Get b-roll of people walking around, machinery operating, or whatever challenging sound you are dealing with in the large space. Cutting to these noise makers will give the audience a reference for the background noise, which helps conceal it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Best-Handheld-Microphone-for-Interviews"><a href="#6-Best-Handheld-Microphone-for-Interviews" class="headerlink" title="6.

If you’re using GoPro Hero4 for shooting all your intense water shots, you would be familiar with the awful audio you capture when the camera is inside the waterproof casing.</p><p>Lucky for you, Sennheiser has developed a waterproof microphone, the MKE 2 elements. This little furry ball that connects to your GoPro Hero4 can withstand up to 1 meter of water. Because underwater sound is captured differently (via a <a class="link"   href="https://www.azosensors.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=13" >hydrophone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), the Sennheiser MKE 2 elements can’t actually record audio underwater, however, it’ll be ready to keep recording quality audio once it resurfaces.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Double check to make sure that the mic cable is not blocking the seal of the waterproof case of the camera before launching it into the water.</p><p>Different situations call for different equipment. This is the true for tradespeople, golfers, and YouTubers. If you want to get the best audio, it’s more than simply buying the most expensive one, you’ll also need to find the microphone most suited for that situation.</p><p> <em>I hope this post helped you improve your audio quality.

The number of gamers is growing every day, and that means more and more people are looking for content from experienced gamers on YouTube and Twitch. To produce great YouTube gaming videos, you’ll need a lot of gaming knowledge and a few pieces of high-quality equipment, including a good headset. Without a headset, it might be hard to keep track of in-game audio cues while entertaining your audience.</p><p>Most hardware manufacturers are actively targeting the gaming market, releasing specialized headset models for 2024. Here is a quick overview of the five best candidates for the title of the best gaming headset for 2024:</p><p> <strong><a href="#razer">1.

The headset features a modern ergonomic design with earcups that fit very tightly and completely seal off the outside world. Razer Man O’War looks bulky, but it weighs just over 330 grams and uses an analog 3.5 mm connector.</p><p>The microphone boom extends from the left ear cup and can be easily adjusted or retracted. Most importantly, microphone controls are very sophisticated allowing for in-game switching between channels without disruption. When used for talking, the microphone will ensure absolute clarity, which comes handy for those who broadcast their games on YouTube.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Wireless setup for maximum freedom</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Minimizes ambient noise with cushion-like ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lightweight and comfortable to wear</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fully retractable, high-quality MEMS microphone</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Long-lasting batteries – up to 14 hours</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Occasional loss of connectivity</p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Slightly expensive for a plastic build</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset"><a href="#2-Audio-Technica-ATH-ADG1-Open-Air-High-Fidelity-Headset" class="headerlink" title="2.

This characteristic is a huge strength, especially when coupled with its broad compatibility and innovative design. The structure of this headset is unique, with an open-air setup that allows for the circulation of air under the set, which is useful during long gaming sessions. This comes at a price since the isolation against ambient noise is less than perfect and the feeling might be a bit awkward until you get used to it.</p><p>As for the microphone, it is permanently attached to the left side of the headset with a flexible stem, so it can be easily adjusted to the desired position. This implies that ATH-ADG1 was made specifically for those who need to communicate while receiving the high-quality audio feed, such as gaming streamers.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Extremely light and uniquely built for comfort</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Top-notch audio quality above its class</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Innovative, self-adjusting frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Comfortable ear cups</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p>   <strong>-</strong> Analog headset, so the quality depends on the connected device</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Specialized product with a narrow range of applications</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Fragile build that can easily be damaged</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Very expensive</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148775/18498" target="_top" id="2148775">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148775" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148775/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430"><a href="#3-Logitec-Surround-Sound-Gaming-Headset-G430" class="headerlink" title="3.

Its most touted feature is the surround sound system, which is not common in this price range. This allows for very realistic in-game audio, particularly because the headset has an excellent bass channel. In addition to solid audio performance, the Logitec gaming headset is characterized by low weight rotating ear cups with a protective cloth and vibrant coloring.</p><p>A standard 3.5 mm connector is used for the microphone, which is conveniently positioned and capable of clearly capturing speech while blocking out other sounds. Unfortunately, the microphone can’t be easily manipulated and doesn’t offer the option to be muted automatically, although a manual switch is available to turn it off. For a budget gaming headset, that’s a fair compromise.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Realistic, immersive sound</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Smart design optimized to decrease weight</p><p> <strong>-</strong> The Durable cloth covering the ear cups</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround effect on a cheap gaming headset</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent price-to-quality ratio</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of programmable commands</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Poor protection against ambient noise</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Less than impressive visually</p><h2 id="4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#4-Razer-Kraken-7-1-Chroma-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="4.

It is pretty affordable compared to the other Razer headset on this list (the Man O’ War), but it is equally robust when it comes to performance, including high-quality surround audio. This is a rather large headset with thick ear cups decorated with a glowing logo of the brand, but its size is not a problem since Kraken is very comfortable even when worn continually for hours.</p><p>Kraken’s fully retractable and flexible microphone can be hidden under the left cup when not in use, giving this model a bit of versatility. It picks up your voice even when it’s bent sideways, so YouTube professionals won’t have to worry about the exact positioning while engaged in a fierce battle. It’s also possible to use a toggle switch to mute the microphone quickly.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Excellent audio for its price range</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Surround audio contributes to the more complete gaming experience</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Completely isolates any ambient sounds</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Flexible mic that can be moved out of the way</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Access to Synapse 2.0 software</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> USB only, no 3.5 mm jacks</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Lack of preset settings for gaming</p><p> <strong>-</strong> A sensitive microphone that sometimes picks up unwanted sounds</p><h2 id="5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset"><a href="#5-HyperX-Cloud-II-Gaming-Headset" class="headerlink" title="5.

It comes with optional surround audio that can be plugged in via sound card, or disconnected when this effect is not needed. The headset was originally designed to work perfectly on the Xbox, but it retains compatibility with most desktops, laptops, and consoles.</p><p>The detachable microphone is very solid and particularly effective in filtering noise and eliminating echo. It can be easily moved into any position or removed altogether when the headset is used for any purpose other than game streaming.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> b and elegant aluminum frame</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Advanced audio control box</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Virtual 7.1 surround audio</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Interchangeable ear pads</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Premium look and feel at an affordable price</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><p> <strong>-</strong> Inconveniently positioned mute switch</p><p> <strong>-</strong> Relatively short cord limiting movement</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148641/16836" target="_top" id="2148641">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148641" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="254" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148641/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Gamers-Wondershare-Filmora9" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Gamers- Wondershare Filmora9</h2><p>No doubt gamers would need a lot of effects and overlays to edit a live stream video to show the best effects on the game screen.

When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels.

PIXLR EDITOR"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" >PIXLR EDITOR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006933/19272" target="_top" id="2006933">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006933" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006933/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-GETPAINT"><a href="#2-GETPAINT" class="headerlink" title="2.

Canva is a simpler design tool.

YouTube is the world’s biggest video sharing platform that already allows its users to stream live videos through third-party applications such as Wirecast Play or OBS. Less than a month ago, YouTube has finally made possible live streaming directly from a computer’s webcam. The option is currently only available on Chrome browsers, but the company claims that more browsers will start offering this feature soon.</p><p>In this article, we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to create seamless live streams using a webcam and introduce you to some of the best webcam models in 2021.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021"><a href="#Best-webcams-for-YouTube-Livestreaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021"></a>Best webcams for YouTube Livestreaming in 2021</h2><p>The quality of the video recording you intend to broadcast live is essential for the success of your live streams. Most built-in laptop webcams produce low-quality videos, and for that reason using an external webcam that captures high-resolution videos can help you create live streams that attract a lot of attention from YouTube’s community.</p><h3 id="How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-webcam-for-live-streaming-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?"></a>How to choose the right webcam for live streaming on YouTube?</h3><p><strong>Compatability:</strong> Even the best webcams on the market are completely useless if they are not compatible with your computer. Finding a webcam that works with a PC or a Mac shouldn’t be too difficult because both Windows and iOS platforms offer support for a wide range of models.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> YouTubers that just want to produce simple live streams don’t have to pay a lot of attention to the video resolution, because their videos don’t show too many details. Vloggers and gamers, on the other hand, should consider using webcams that produce 4K or HD footage since lower-priced options have a hard time realistically depicting colors. The quality of the video output a webcam produces can increase its price significantly, so there’s no reason investing in it if you don’t have the intention of utilizing its features to the fullest.</p><p><strong>Sound Quality:</strong> Besides the video features, you should also look into the webcam’s audio options, because no one wants to watch a video with a terrible sound. Buying an external microphone is probably the best solution to this issue, but if you can’t afford one, then purchasing a webcam with decent audio recording features is the second best option.</p><p><strong>Adjustable Location:</strong> Although the angle from which you are recording a stream may not seem important, poorly framed live streams are more likely to go unnoticed. A webcam that is easily adjustable can grant you the freedom of choosing your shots on every live stream you share online and it will enable you to control each and every detail in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934142/19272" target="_top" id="1934142">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934142" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934142/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896555/19272" target="_top" id="1896555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896555/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885947/19272" target="_top" id="1885947">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885947" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885947/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021"><a href="#4-Best-Webcams-for-YouTube-Live-streaming-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021"></a>4 Best Webcams for YouTube Live streaming in 2021</h3><p>There are thousands of different webcams you can use to record a live stream, but the models featured below are some of the very best currently available on the market.</p><h4 id="1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam"><a href="#1-Logitech-4K-Pro-webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.

The cable is attached to the microphone and is 6.5 feet (2 meters) long, which isn’t a wide range. It’s pretty much restricted to the desk with your computer. This microphone has limitations, and high-achieving YouTubers will certainly grow out of it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-50" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $50"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $50</strong></h2><h4 id="Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99"><a href="#Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Microphone-23-99" class="headerlink" title="Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99"></a><strong>Purple Panda Lavalier Microphone - $23.99</strong></h4><p><strong>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lavalier microphone comes with multiple adapters and is compatible with nearly all devices, including smartphone, DSLR, computers, and even GoPro cameras.

When you join the affiliate program of an online store they will allow you to create special links, called affiliate links, to products listed there. You post these affiliate links in the descriptions of your video reviews and, if viewers choose to click on those links and buy the products, you will earn a sales commission. Here are some stores with great affiliate programs:</p><h4 id="1-JVZoo"><a href="#1-JVZoo" class="headerlink" title="1. JVZoo"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="http://www.jvzoo.com/" >JVZoo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>You can find high end products for about $5 to $10. Budgeting will be important if you plan on purchasing products to review instead of only reviewing products you already own (you should try to review items you already have as much as possible).</p><h4 id="2-Click-Bank"><a href="#2-Click-Bank" class="headerlink" title="2. Click Bank"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="http://www.clickbank.com/" >Click Bank <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>You can find a wide range of interesting products here, and you can earn as much as 75% on sales commissions if you provide your viewers with an affiliate link.</p><h4 id="3-Warrior-Plus"><a href="#3-Warrior-Plus" class="headerlink" title="3.

Until then, you can buy the products yourself or review products which you already own. It will be a lot cheaper to review things you already have, or which you were already planning to buy, than to buy products for the purpose of reviewing them. Your reviews will also be more detailed and useful when they are on products you are especially familiar with.</p><p>Once you start building a following, brands will come to you and it will be your choice whether you want to review the things they send you. Until then, try to promote&#x2F;review products you already have opinions on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975821/19272" target="_top" id="1975821">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975821" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975821/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-3-Filming-the-Video"><a href="#Part-3-Filming-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:  Filming the Video"></a>Part 3:  Filming the Video</h3><p>Be completely honest. People are going to know when you are trying to sell something. Fake reviewers are all over the place, and they are easily spotted.</p><p>That does not mean you shouldn’t make money through affiliate links, or accept free products to review. So long as you are honest in your opinions, and open with your viewers about any relationships you have with brands, you are not ‘selling out’.</p><p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p><p>It takes time to earn any money reviewing products on YouTube.

There is still the question if the YouTube Video Editor is good, and if it replaces desktop editors. Hopefully, our YouTube Video Editor Review helps you figure out if you want to use the editor.</p><hr><p>Want to make your YouTube video more attractive and beautiful? here I recommend an easy-to-use video editing software - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which not only allows you cut, crop, rotate, and split your videos in minutes, but also simplify the advanced video editing like green screen effect and PIP. You can also find over 300 video effects like Fashion, Beauty, Gaming, Education, etc.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><hr><h2 id="YouTube-Video-Editor-Review"><a href="#YouTube-Video-Editor-Review" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Video Editor Review"></a>YouTube Video Editor Review</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong> From 20th September 2017 users will no longer be able to use the complimentary editing suite.

Now the YouTube video editor is able to add video effects to the video and create multiple projects at the same time. While the editor can do more, it has stayed a simple tool.</p><p>This simplicity makes it very easy and quick to use. Unlike desktop editors, the YouTube Editor processes much faster. Since the tool is designed to be easy to use, you can learn to use the YouTube Editor in very little time. However, due to its simplicity, it does not offer all the same features. Some of the features that are missing means that it is not suited for every project.</p><h4 id="The-Basic-Features"><a href="#The-Basic-Features" class="headerlink" title="The Basic Features"></a><strong>The Basic Features</strong></h4><h4 id="1-The-editor"><a href="#1-The-editor" class="headerlink" title="1.The editor"></a>1.The editor</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-6.jpg"                      alt="YouTube Video Editor review and guide"                ></p><p>The YouTube Video Editor does come with some standard video editing functions like video splicing, Audioswap, and cropping videos. The video editor needs to have the videos already uploaded to YouTube. Along with using your own videos, you have the option to use videos that are part of the Creative Commons library. There transitions, and other features that other standard video editors have. Audioswap is easy to use, and there is access to the Creative Commons library in the editor.</p><h4 id="2-The-Enhancements"><a href="#2-The-Enhancements" class="headerlink" title="2.

Enhancements can be found by clicking on a video picture after it has been added to the project. Enhancements are broken into four categories: Quick Fixes, Filters, Text, and Audio. Quick fixes are basic adjustments for small issues like the contrast and saturation of the video. YouTube added an auto-fix button and stabilize video button to make it quick to fix these issues. The filters, text, and audio, are about the same that you would find with any other video editing software.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Want to know how to use the Enhancements feature in YouTube?

It is also super easy to learn. If you have a Google+ account, you can photos to your video straight from your cloud storage. You also have access to all the videos that you have uploaded to YouTube. All the features are easy to use, and many can be dragged and dropped making editing easy. Google is still improving the YouTube Video Editor to have more features and run smoother.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> Want to know YouTube alternatives?

Another major con is that the video editor is fully online. This means that a refresh is needed to see the changes that you have made. After the refresh of the video, the video jumps back to the beginning of the video making it frustrating to edit the end of a video. There is also no real way of shortening music in the editor at the moment. Unlike many desk top video editors, you cannot overlap music or video clips. This means that some of the transitions are choppy.</p><h4 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h4><p>Since Google is still working on the YouTube Video Editor, hopefully, most of kinks will be worked out soon. While the YouTube Video Editor is getting better, it is still have the most basic features. The easy to use nature of the editor may mean that it stays more of a simple to use video tool. This does make it easy to edit, and it’s good for most projects. Millions of people use this editor because it is so easy to use. However, more advanced projects are still going to need a desktop video editor. We are hoping to see more advanced features in the future.</p><p>Many YouTubers and everyday people like the YouTube Video Editor, for its ease of use and the quick video editing that it provides. However, if it is right for you, depends greatly on what you are trying to do. If you plan on doing any editing past cropping videos, adding type and transitions, and switching music, you are better off using a desktop video editor.

The higher the percentage, the more people are watching your entire video.</p><p>If you get above <strong>60%</strong> Average Percentage Viewed, you should feel very proud. In our modern world with our short attention span, that is considered good retention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-one.png"                      alt="audience-retention-one"                ></p><p>In the example above, we see that on average, a viewer will only see 44% of the video. For the video below, we see that it only has 30% of the video viewed. Overall, the first video is performing better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/audience-retention-two.jpg"                      alt="audience-retention-two"                ></p><p>There is also a dip that happens at the beginning in the second example, which indicates that viewers are skipping forward and about 20% then deciding it’s not worth continuing. It’s good data to help you improve your introduction and the hook.</p><p>If there is important information that you are presenting at a given point and in the Audience Retention you see that only a small percentage of your viewers actually see it, then for the next video, you might want to position the details in a different point in the video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135368/19272" target="_top" id="2135368">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135368" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135368/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention"><a href="#How-to-Improve-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="How to Improve Audience Retention"></a><strong>How to Improve Audience Retention</strong></h3><p>Here are a few ways you can retain your audience’s attention if you noticed a drop in viewership:</p><p><strong>- Film a hook</strong> (introduce your video to let the audience know what to expect)</p><p><strong>- Add b-roll</strong> (having supplemental footage to cut to makes your video more interesting to watch)</p><p><strong>- Have a co-host</strong> (Having someone on screen gives the video more dynamic interactions)</p><p><strong>- Edit out the unimportant stuff</strong></p><p><strong>- Write a conclusion</strong> (having a conclusion prepared will allow you to transition from the content of the video to the call to action without the audience even knowing) See this example by PolyMatter below and notice how seamless their ending is.</p><p>If you have a video that is doing a good job retaining the audience, then replicate it. If there isn’t, keep experimenting with new structures. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Improving audience retention <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not simply important for your ranking, but it will affirm that you are building quality videos.</p><p>Knowing how to structure your video will allow you to be strategic as you build out your content.</p><h2 id="2-Do-Keyword-Research"><a href="#2-Do-Keyword-Research" class="headerlink" title="2.

The higher the number the more popular it is. You should aim to use keywords with a high search volume.</p><p><strong>Keyword competition score:</strong> This score is usually indicated by a number and it represents how difficult it is for a keyword to rank due to other pages already ranking for that word or phrase. You want to find a keyword with a low competition score.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> The best combination is high search volume and low competition score. But if you can’t get that perfect mix, go for the low competitive score, as it will give you a better chance to rank, even if it isn’t searched as often.</p><p><strong>4. Come Up With Content Related to Those Keywords:</strong> To come up with topic ideas around a keyword, you can use a tool called <a class="link"   href="https://answerthepublic.com/" >Answer the Public <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which gives you all the most popular questions searched online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/answer-the-public.jpg"                      alt="answer-the-public"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Engage-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Engage-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3.

Domino effect!</p><p>- More people will see your video and like it, increasing your network of viewers and your watch time, which is one of the main factors that YouTube takes into consideration.</p><p> <strong>Get engagements with a call to action</strong>:</p><p>- Don’t be afraid to ask for an engagement at the beginning of the video to avoid fall off on retention.</p><p>- Encourage them to leave a comment or start a discussion by asking a question at the end of your video.</p><p>- Monitor comments and responds to them so you can build a relationship with your audience over time.</p><p>It’s all about creating a community and that is what YouTube encourages.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length"><a href="#4-Upload-YouTube-Video-in-Proper-Length" class="headerlink" title="4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:"></a><strong>4. Upload YouTube Video in Proper Length:</strong></h2><p>YouTube puts a lot of weight on watch time, and in addition to that, it puts more weight on session watch time.</p><p>Session watch time is counted when people watch your video and then continue to watch others, it doesn’t have to be your own. The more time people spend watching YouTube videos, as a result of your content, the more likely YouTube will increase your ranking.</p><p>Since YouTube puts importance on time spent watching videos, the length of your video will play a key role.</p><p>If you have 5 videos and all of them are a minute long, a 100% watch through will only get you 5 minutes total.</p><p>However, if you have 1 video that is 20 minutes, and an average viewer only watches half of it, then you have an average watch time of over 10 minutes. <strong>That’s more than double what your five short videos can do.</strong> This longer video is worth more. However, if that 20-minute video is really boring and people drop off in the first minute, then it’s not any better than 1 of the 5 short videos.</p><p>If your format allows, go for a longer video instead of a shorter one. But the most important thing is that you can keep people watching your videos: so use end screen and playlist links to keep them engaged.</p><p><strong>End screen:</strong> Pick related videos for your audience, so they know exactly what they should watch next. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >create a background template for your end screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/related-videos-for-your-audience.jpg"                      alt="related-videos-for-your-audience"                ></p><p><strong>Playlist</strong>: If you have multiple videos that fit a specific topic, add them to a playlist so the viewer can enjoy them all in one viewing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist.jpg"                      alt="add-videos-of-the-same-topic-to-a-playlist"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways:"></a><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h4><ol><li>Use <strong>Audience Retention</strong> to better understand how to structure your video for the best results.</li><li>Perform <strong>Keyword Research</strong> to find the keywords that your competitors are using and your audience is searching for.</li><li><strong>Increasing Subscribers</strong> gets your video in front of more people the moment it is published.</li><li><strong>Encourage Comments</strong> and respond to establish a relationship with your viewers.</li><li>Ensure that <strong>Viewers Continue Watching</strong> videos on YouTube after they finish watching yours.</li></ol><h2 id="Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking"><a href="#Other-Things-That-Affects-Your-YouTube-Ranking" class="headerlink" title="Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking"></a><strong>Other Things That Affects Your YouTube Ranking</strong></h2><p>Except for the above-mentioned factors, there are also other issues that affect the ranking of your YouTube video.

When you visit YouTube after installing TubeBuddy a whole new set of useful tools becomes available.</p><p>TubeBuddy’s tools were designed to save you time and effort when performing some of the more mundane tasks involved in running a YouTube channel, like adding cards. Many of TubeBuddy’s tools are completely free to use, but others might require a paid license. There are three levels of licensing: $9, $19, or $39 per month.</p><h4 id="The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Using-TubeBuddy-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube"></a>The Benefits of Using TubeBuddy for YouTube</h4><ol><li><a href="#productivity"><strong>Increased Productivity</strong></a></li><li><a href="#bulk"><strong>Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></a></li><li><a href="#tags"><strong>Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></a></li><li><a href="#data"><strong>Useful Data</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="Benefits-of-TubeBuddy"><a href="#Benefits-of-TubeBuddy" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of TubeBuddy"></a><strong>Benefits of TubeBuddy</strong></h2><p>YouTubers who use TubeBuddy are able to spend less time on busy-work and more time on coming up with creative video ideas. Here are some of the ways TubeBuddy can help you, especially if you have a large or mid-sized channel:</p><h4 id="1-Increased-Productivity"><a href="#1-Increased-Productivity" class="headerlink" title="1. Increased Productivity"></a><strong>1. Increased Productivity</strong></h4><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s Productivity Tools are available for free, but some require a $9 per month Pro license.</p><p>You can use these tools to get your videos ready for posting faster, embed them off-YouTube more easily, and save time by creating canned responses or templates for cards and annotations.</p><p>For example, you might find yourself creating the same YouTube Card over and over again to include it in every video you make. Creating a template through TubeBuddy will save you this effort.</p><p>Another great productivity tool is the Video Topic Planner. You can save video ideas you come up with, or ideas viewers have suggested to you, and arrange them in a queue so you never forget what you are planning to make next.</p><h4 id="2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More"><a href="#2-Bulk-Tools-for-Annotations-Cards-Thumbnails-and-More" class="headerlink" title="2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More"></a><strong>2. Bulk Tools for Annotations, Cards, Thumbnails and More</strong></h4><p><strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tubebuddy-bulk-tools.jpg"                      alt="TubeBuddy bulk tools"                ></strong></p><p>Most of TubeBuddy’s bulk processing tools require a $19 per month Star license.</p><p>Two of the most time-saving tools in this section are the Bulk Copy tools for cards and annotations. They will save you from having to recreate the same ones over and over. Then, using the Bulk Update tools, you will be able to make changes to all of your cards or annotations at once.</p><p>For example: if you use a YouTube Card to link to your personal website and include it in every video, and then you change your website, you change the link in all of your existing cards at once.</p><p>Another useful Bulk tool is Bulk Thumbnail Overlays, which will allow you to add a logo to all of your existing video thumbnails at once.</p><h4 id="3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags"><a href="#3-Quick-Optimization-for-Your-Video’s-Tags" class="headerlink" title="3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags"></a><strong>3. Quick Optimization for Your Video’s Tags</strong></h4><p>The SEO Tools in TubeBuddy will help you find the best tags for your videos and suggest tags you might want to target. Many of these tools are free, but others require a $19 Star license.</p><p>One of the best free tools in this category is View and Copy Video Tags. It allows you to see and copy the tags of other people’s videos. You will be able to see which keywords your competitors are targeting (and look for opportunities to target them more effectively). This can also save you a lot of time writing out tags that should really be the same as the ones on an existing video.</p><h4 id="4-Useful-Data"><a href="#4-Useful-Data" class="headerlink" title="4. Useful Data"></a><strong>4. Useful Data</strong></h4><p>The most useful piece of data under Data and Research Tools is the Best Time to Publish. How many views you get on a video could vary greatly depending on when you post, and the best times to post vary depending on the demographics of your audience. This free tool from TubeBuddy will show you when you should be uploading.</p><p>Another interesting tool, which is unfortunately only available with $39 licenses, is the Competitor Scoreboard. It allows creators to compare their channels stats to those of their rival channels.</p><p> Have you ever tried TubeBuddy for YouTube?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-leading-windows-call-platforms-7-1-ranked/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Leading Windows Call Platforms #7-#1 Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-economical-growth-methodology-subscribe-now/"><u>[New] In 2024, Economical Growth Methodology - Subscribe Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ost-youtube-video-on-the-best-days-to-get-more-view/"><u>[New] Post Youtube Video on the Best Days to Get More View</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-a-step-by-step-guide-to-your-profit-share-in-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved A Step-by-Step Guide to Your Profit Share in YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/1716069210674-updated-2024-approved-essential-offline-ios-game-list-unplugged-fun-awaits/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Essential Offline iOS Game List - Unplugged Fun Awaits!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-thriving-in-live-streaming-mastery-through-onestream-use/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Thriving in Live Streaming Mastery Through OneStream Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-precise-mac-recording-without-costs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Precise Mac Recording Without Costs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-youtubers-overture-orchestrating-video-triumphs/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The YouTuber’s Overture Orchestrating Video Triumphs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-youtube-views-secrets-for-a-million-followers/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Youtube Views Secrets for a Million Followers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ovative-yt-tales-share-your-life-journey-for-2024/"><u>5 Innovative YT Tales Share Your Life Journey for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ing-viewer-interest-with-optimal-video-thumbnail-sizes-for-2024/"><u>Boosting Viewer Interest with Optimal Video Thumbnail Sizes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-android-lock-screen-using-emergency-call-on-oppo-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Oppo?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-oneplus-nord-n30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Spy on Text Messages from Computer & OnePlus Nord N30 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-ultimate-voice-transformation-tools-for-social-media-stars/"><u>In 2024, Ultimate Voice Transformation Tools for Social Media Stars</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-unova-stone-pokemon-go-evolution-list-and-how-catch-them-for-zte-blade-a73-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Unova Stone Pokémon Go Evolution List and How Catch Them For ZTE Blade A73 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-to-using-an-additional-hard-drive-for-gaming/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide to Using an Additional Hard Drive for Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-rundll32exe-how-to-handle-it-correctly/"><u>What Is the Purpose of rundll32.exe?

Your audience is not going to stick around to watch your whole video if your content isn’t enticing or relatable. If you want to get people to watch all your videos, you need to get them emotionally invested with your stories.</p><p>Here are 3 methods for creating an awesome story:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: CREATE SUSPENSE</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: USE EMPATHY</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: TAKE THE AUDIENCE ON A MEANINGFUL JOURNEY</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-Create-Suspense"><a href="#1-Create-Suspense" class="headerlink" title="1. Create Suspense"></a>1. Create Suspense</h2><p>The hero has an objective, but the plan might fail.</p><p>The likelihood of something going wrong is what makes a story suspenseful. When you tell a suspenseful story, your audience will have a heightened focus and a strong motivation to continue listening. They want to know if the hero succeeds. Keep the audience waiting and expecting. Don’t give away the ending right away.</p><h4 id="What-Does-a-Suspenseful-Story-Sound-Like"><a href="#What-Does-a-Suspenseful-Story-Sound-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does a Suspenseful Story Sound Like?"></a>What Does a Suspenseful Story Sound Like?</h4><p>When we talk about a story that is dragging on, it is because there is no suspense. There is nothing at stake, there are no obstacles, there is no problem and, with no problem, there is no promise of resolution.</p><p>Here are a few examples you can use to pump more suspense into your story:</p><p>- Address a fear (example: being alone for the prom)</p><p>- An objective (example: asking the crush out to the dance)</p><p>- Consequences of failing (example: being embarrassed in front of the whole school)</p><p>- Limited time (example: prom is next week)</p><p>- Obstacles (example: the crush has an aggressive ex.)</p><p>You can feel your heart rate speeding up simply thinking about the character’s story in the example. Does it have a happy ending or not? We want to know!</p><h4 id="Raise-Questions-After-Questions"><a href="#Raise-Questions-After-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Raise Questions After Questions"></a>Raise Questions After Questions</h4><p>A good storyteller knows that as soon as they answer a question for their audience, they need to present another one. The audience will always need to have a puzzle in their mind, one that needs to be solved. That is what will keep their interest.</p><p>For example: If the hero ends up going to the prom with his crush, the next big question can be: Will they kiss at the last dance?</p><p>This continues building on the tension and increasing the stakes evermore.</p><p>Check out the suspenseful story from YouTuber, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKN9PT9mTOnUHqUnEE0gfyw" >MissRemiAshten <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The way she tells the story, we discover more and about her psycho neighbor and the incident gradually. A little bit of information about the neighbor is revealed at a time… not all at once.</p><h4 id="Include-a-Cliffhanger"><a href="#Include-a-Cliffhanger" class="headerlink" title="Include a Cliffhanger"></a>Include a Cliffhanger</h4><p>We’ve all had those moments at the end of an intense television show where we are shouting at the screen because it suddenly cut to black as the main characters were left in a precarious position. That emotional outburst is brought to us by a good cliffhanger, and a good cliffhanger can assure us that the audience will return for more.</p><p>But there needs to be more! A cliffhanger is a promise to the viewer that eventually they will be rewarded for their patience and it will be satisfying.</p><p>In this cliffhanger from Casey Neistat, he simply asks us a question, “Was that good?” This calls upon us to recall all the awesome YouTube videos we have seen created by filmmakers that aren’t considered “prestigious.” A cliffhanger does not have to end with an epic reveal; it can wrap up with loose ends and allow the audience to tie it up themselves.</p><h4 id="How-to-Deliver-a-Good-Cliffhanger"><a href="#How-to-Deliver-a-Good-Cliffhanger" class="headerlink" title="How to Deliver a Good Cliffhanger"></a>How to Deliver a Good Cliffhanger</h4><p>Applying good cliffhangers to your YouTube videos is a balancing act. You want to draw your audience in, but you also need to have a payoff that is worth the wait.</p><p>Done well, a cliffhanger will leave your audience wanting more. Done poorly, a cliffhanger will leave your audience feeling to mislead and a little ripped off, hesitant to listen to more stories from you.</p><p>A good cliffhanger does not have to be life or death, but it does have to be the moment the story has been leading up to.</p><p><strong>Before you start telling your story, consider the key details that are most impactful.</strong></p><p>Once you have the points you want to hit, plan out the reveal. Weave the story together, but withhold the pivotal details until the cliffhanger. Then<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >deliver it on camera confidently <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Here are two ways you can present your cliffhanger for amplified effect:</p><h4 id="1-Slow-Down-and-Have-Pauses"><a href="#1-Slow-Down-and-Have-Pauses" class="headerlink" title="1. Slow Down and Have Pauses"></a>1. Slow Down and Have Pauses</h4><p>As your story intensifies, bring the pace down — or stop completely. The silence becomes the cliffhanger. It can last a second or more, depending on how confident you are in the tension you have built.</p><p>Your next words or shots can be the reveal. If you are skilled enough, you can lead into another story one that connects to the previous. If you are trying this, make sure that in the end, the payoff has double the impact. The reveal needs to be twice as powerful if you are going to take the audience on another journey before wrapping up and answering the long-awaited questions.</p><h4 id="2-Use-Repetition"><a href="#2-Use-Repetition" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Repetition"></a>2. Use Repetition</h4><p>Whether you want to misdirect your audience or hammer home a point, using repetition throughout your story will help you build the tension you need to establish the cliffhanger.</p><p>In this example, we see YouTuber, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/moniGobaira" >A little bit of Monika <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses both pace and repetition in her storytelling method.</p><p>The video starts off at a speedy pace, all the way until the last scene where the confrontation occurs. That’s her slowing down the story so that we are all anticipating the reveal. Is she or is she not actor, Saoirse Ronan?</p><p>Through this short video, the repetition of the name is used to show her confidence that her roommate is not who she said it is. The more affirming she becomes, the more likely we as the viewers are going to side with her. This is a simple example of misdirection.</p><p>The more you say something or show something, the more important it becomes for the audience — at least, you want it to appear important.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Use-Empathy"><a href="#2-Use-Empathy" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Empathy"></a>2. Use Empathy</h2><p>A storyteller must be empathetic.</p><p>If your audience cannot empathize with what you are communicating, it would not have the intended effect. Storytelling is all about taking people out of their bodies and putting them in someone else’s.</p><p>If you are telling a story about the time your car broke down, you want people to empathize and feel the helplessness of being stuck on a highway, waving cars down to help.</p><p>Empathy makes people feel more human. Telling a story people can relate to, even if it didn’t happen to them, is a sign of a quality storyteller.</p><h4 id="Don’t-Use-Too-Many-Facts-and-Figures"><a href="#Don’t-Use-Too-Many-Facts-and-Figures" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Use Too Many Facts and Figures"></a>Don’t Use Too Many Facts and Figures</h4><p>If you began your story by saying that 1&#x2F;1,000 cars on the highway break down, that doesn’t evoke any major emotion. There is nothing human about it.</p><p>It’s an interesting stat, sure, but the audience is unsure how they should respond. Is that a lot? Is that because of the highway? Is it because of the drivers? Nobody knows… it’s numbered with no context.</p><p>However, if you told the story about that time you had to abandon your vehicle and walk down the highway in order to make your important appointment. Suddenly, the audience can empathize with the tribulations you have gone through.</p><p>Facts and figures are useful in reports, but not as much in compelling stories.</p><h4 id="Evoke-the-Senses"><a href="#Evoke-the-Senses" class="headerlink" title="Evoke the Senses"></a>Evoke the Senses</h4><p>If I talk about hot melting chocolate, standing in the rain, or the smell of your grandmother’s bedroom, your senses are activated. From all your life experiences, your brain is able to form familiar sensations without any physical changes to your surrounding. That’s the power of storytelling.</p><p>Good storytellers use these sensory details and descriptive imagery to spice up a story. This draws the audience in and gives them a more immersive experience when listening to your stories.</p><p>Ask yourself these questions:</p><p>- What does it smell like?</p><p>- What can you hear?</p><p>- What do you see?</p><p>- What can you physically feel?</p><p>This example from YouTuber, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPVLz21lU7TG39ogUvPFFjA" >Kiril Dobrev <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> perfectly exemplifies what sensory igniting storytelling can do. He illustrates the sensation of being in Hong Kong, not simply through visuals but physical motions and audio effects.</p><h4 id="Use-Metaphors"><a href="#Use-Metaphors" class="headerlink" title="Use Metaphors"></a>Use Metaphors</h4><p>As a YouTube storyteller, sometimes you will have to communicate complex ideas. When that happens, <a class="link"   href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT%5F93.htm" >use a metaphor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to increase the impact.</p><p>If you are telling a story about how much you dislike your teacher, you can list off all the ways she is unlikable or you can sum it up with a line like this: “My teacher makes the school a prison.”</p><p>That is a metaphor comparing school to prison. Most people haven’t been to prison, but understand what the metaphor is insinuating. School is not a fun place to be because of that teacher.</p><p>By connecting two different things, you allow the audience to paint the image in their mind quickly. It doesn’t take a lot of words to create a memorable metaphor. I encourage you to use metaphors anytime you need to address something complicated.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145079/17095" target="_top" id="2145079">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145079" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145079/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Take-the-Audience-on-a-Meaningful-Journey"><a href="#3-Take-the-Audience-on-a-Meaningful-Journey" class="headerlink" title="3. Take the Audience on a Meaningful Journey"></a>3. Take the Audience on a Meaningful Journey</h2><p>Perhaps the most important element of a good story is that the journey is meaningful.</p><p>- Is it educational?</p><p>- Is it entertaining?</p><p>- Is it motivational or inspiring?</p><p>Knowing how you want to leave your audience feeling is foresight that will improve your YouTube storytelling abilities. Before you start telling your tale, ask: How do I want to change my audience?</p><p>YouTuber, <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jamiewindsor" >Jamie Windsor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> tells a few stories connected to creativity and plagiarism. Anyone who has ever created anything can relate to his story and thus his audience can empathize.</p><p>It is also clear as a viewer that at the end of this 15-minute long video, his audience will have gone on a meaningful journey with him.</p><p>His story is a cautionary tale.

A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Ad-Quality"><a href="#Ad-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Ad Quality"></a>Ad Quality</h3><p>The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what’s happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely.

We’ll show you what the impact of the Youtube Partner program is on the revenue of YouTube channel owners:</p><h3 id="Video-length-1"><a href="#Video-length-1" class="headerlink" title="Video length"></a>Video length</h3><p>One of the most noteworthy characteristics of a YouTube video is its length. A longer video provides a greater amount of information, which means a greater likelihood of the viewer actually watching it to completion.</p><h3 id="Ad-Quality-1"><a href="#Ad-Quality-1" class="headerlink" title="Ad Quality"></a>Ad Quality</h3><p>The two main qualities that differentiate high-quality YouTube ads are relevance and timeliness. It would be best if you tailored the ad to what’s happening within the video to be relevant. For instance, an ad about a new study may be relevant if the video is about health or science. The ad should also be timely. If you’re looking to get more revenue out of your channel, the quality of your ads should be high.</p><h3 id="Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives-1"><a href="#Number-of-clicks-each-ad-receives-1" class="headerlink" title="Number of clicks each ad receives"></a>Number of clicks each ad receives</h3><p>The number of times your video ad is shown is an important factor in how much it makes. You can increase your ads’ revenue potential by increasing the ad’s number of clicks. Advertisers use this metric to gauge the effectiveness of their campaigns, which is why optimizing the number of clicks your ads get is so important.</p><h3 id="Ad-Blockers-1"><a href="#Ad-Blockers-1" class="headerlink" title="Ad Blockers"></a>Ad Blockers</h3><p>And there are two problems with ad blocking.
