Let’s start by taking a look at the best YouTube keyword tools available.</p><h4 id="1-YouTube-autocomplete"><a href="#1-YouTube-autocomplete" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube autocomplete"></a>1. YouTube autocomplete</h4><p>When you start to search for something on YouTube, you’ll probably notice that YouTube suggests some keywords to finish your search. This is called autocomplete, and it works by suggesting the most popular keywords that start with the letters you’ve typed so far. What it is essentially saying is that those are the most frequently searched for terms that use the words you’ve already typed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-auto-complete.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>This means it’s a great place to start building your keywords, and a fantastic YouTube keyword tool for your videos. Just start your search for your video (e.g. shoes for…) and see what comes up. In this case, we can see that the most popular keywords are ‘girls’, ‘men’, ‘kids’, ‘summer’ and ‘boys’.</p><h4 id="2-Keywordtool-io"><a href="#2-Keywordtool-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Keywordtool.io"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordtool.io/youtube" >Keywordtool.io <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Without doubt, this is one of the most powerful YouTube keyword tools out there, ranking hundreds of keywords by popularity. It captures data from YouTube autocomplete and allows you to create lists of keywords from that data. As well as autocompete data, you can also search for questions people are asking, which makes it highly beneficial as a YouTube SEO tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>The downside to this particular tool is that it’s fairly limited on the free version. Upgrading to Pro Basic will give you almost double the keyword results and will let you compare the volume of searches made for those terms too. However, this will set you back around $68 a year, so it’s going to be something of an investment if you go for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keyword-io-result.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool "                ></p><h4 id="3-SEOChat"><a href="#3-SEOChat" class="headerlink" title="3. SEOChat"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://seochat.io/tools/keyword-suggest-tool" >SEOChat <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>SEO Chat is an amazing free tool that can generate keyword ideas from Google, Amazon, Bing and YouTube. You can search for keywords from all of those sources or can just search YouTube alone to find your keyword lists. You’ll need a ‘seed’ keyword, such as ‘shoes’, ‘make up’ or ‘marketing’, and then organizes results alphabetically with other letters following your seed keyword.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/seochat-youtube.jpg"                      alt="SEOChat youtube keyword tool SEOChat"                ></p><p>Simply scrolling through the results is going to give you loads of ideas for keywords and possibly content too. The tool also allows you to further expand your results by selecting a keyword and running ‘part two’ of the process, which expands those phrases even further. Your chosen keywords can be exported from the software, ready for use in your YouTube SEO tool.</p><h4 id="4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor"><a href="#4-Gather-keywords-from-your-competitor" class="headerlink" title="4. Gather keywords from your competitor"></a>4. Gather keywords from your competitor</h4><p>Why not learn from the best and see what’s already working for your competitors? Finding their high traffic keywords is easy and can save a lot of time and energy. To do this, pick a channel that is around your size, as they’re your nearest competitors. Steer clear of the huge channels, as you’ll find it hard to rank next to them.</p><p>Click the videos tab to see their content, and sort them by ‘most popular’ to see the ones which got the most views. Take a look at the <strong>title</strong> and the <strong>description</strong> of those videos, and you’ll find a good fistful of proven keywords that you can start using yourself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/most-popular-video-youtube-channel.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>That’s not all though. To maximize your competitor research, let’s dig a little deeper into the <strong>tags</strong> they have used for their videos too. Unfortunately, these are hidden on YouTube, but are easily seen using the page’s HTML. Simply right click on the page and select ‘view source’. Don’t be alarmed at the great stream of HTML that pops up, it’s easy to search using your search function (press ctrl + f on Windows or ⌘ + f on iOS) by typing in ‘keywords’ to the search box. The following terms are the tags used in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-keywords-youtube.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool"                ></p><p>If ploughing through HTML sounds somewhat taxing, there is a handy YouTube SEO tool you can use to display the tags on page. It’s called <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tubebuddy-for-youtube/mhkhmbddkmdggbhaaaodilponhnccicb" >TubeBuddy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and is a Chrome extension which you’ll find in the Chrome store for free.</p><h4 id="5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator"><a href="#5-Keyword-Tool-Dominator" class="headerlink" title="5. Keyword Tool Dominator"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.keywordtooldominator.com/k/youtube-keyword-tool" >Keyword Tool Dominator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>It’s got a grand name, but it’s actually really easy to use and a great place to start if you’re new to YouTube keyword research. Pop in your seed keywords and the Dominator will produce a list of relevant keywords related to those terms. You can then select the most useful and download them to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Keyword-tool-dominator.jpg"                      alt="tool for youtube keyword"                ></p><p>The drawback with this is that you can only perform three searches a day on the free version. Perhaps that’s enough for you to begin with, but if you want to upgrade to the unlimited version, which will also give you search volumes, it’s a one-off fee of $39.99.</p><h4 id="6-Ubersuggest"><a href="#6-Ubersuggest" class="headerlink" title="6. Ubersuggest"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/" >Ubersuggest <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For getting more data on specific keywords, Ubersuggest from the SEO guru that is Neil Patel is one of the best tools out there. As well as showing search volume and competition, you can see other information such as cost per click and the seasonality of the keyword. It’s free to use with no limitations at all, so is well worth checking out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ubersuggest-youtube-keywords.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="7-Google-trends"><a href="#7-Google-trends" class="headerlink" title="7. Google trends"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.com/trends/" >Google trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>We would highly recommend investigating Google Trends as part of your YouTube keyword research, as it is powerful, accurate and, best of all, free! The options let you narrow down the trend results to just YouTube searches, which is great for gaining insights to your search terms. You can narrow down the results to a specific country too, helping you to gain insight into what your target demographic is currently interested in.</p><h4 id="8-VidIQ"><a href="#8-VidIQ" class="headerlink" title="8. VidIQ"></a>8. <a class="link"   href="https://vidiq.com/" >VidIQ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>The keyword tool in VidIQ is one of very few research tools that has a function for just YouTube built in. You can paste in the keywords you want to research, choose the country you wish to target, and it will return all the search volumes and amount of competition, and will score your keywords based on these figures.</p><p>On the downside, there is a fairly complicated subscription process to go through if you want to upgrade from the free version. To be honest, the free version is OK for new users, but for in depth analytics you’re going to want to upgrade eventually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-vidiq.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool VidIQ"                ></p><h4 id="9-Keyword-Keg"><a href="#9-Keyword-Keg" class="headerlink" title="9. Keyword Keg"></a>9. <a class="link"   href="https://keywordkeg.com/youtube-keyword-tool.html" >Keyword Keg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Keyword Keg is definitely one of the most powerful YouTube keyword research tools out there. It offers lots of data, drawn from a variety of data sources including Wikipedia, Alibaba, Playstore and more. There are filters for country and language and you can drill down into issues like buyer intent and product info. However, as with most free YouTube keyword tools, there is a strict limit on what you can do before you pay. In this case, you only get to see the first five results unless you want to upgrade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-keyword-tools-keywordkeg.jpg"                                     ></p><h4 id="10-Kparser"><a href="#10-Kparser" class="headerlink" title="10. Kparser"></a>10. <a class="link"   href="https://kparser.com/youtube-keyword-tool/" >Kparser <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Kparser is a YouTube keyword tool that you should notice. You can use it to find YouTube keywords free to use. More than finding the best core keywords, this tool can also give you suggestions on long tail keywords in every field. By use this, you don’t need to worry that you can’t the right keywords to use in title, description and tags. You also can selcet country and language when searching a YouTube keyword. For searching more than one keyword, remember to seperate them with coma.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/kparser.jpg"                      alt="youtube keyword tool Kparser"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords"><a href="#Part-2-Bonus-Tips-Google-Video-Result-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords"></a>Part 2: Bonus Tips - Google Video Result Keywords</h3><p>Getting your video ranking highly on YouTube is excellent and will certainly bring you more traffic. But, do you know what would be even better than that? Getting your video ranking on Google as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Google-video-result-keywords.jpg"                      alt="Google video result keywords"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896541/19272" target="_top" id="1896541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896541/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To do this you’ll need to find ‘video result keywords’ in Google, so that yours can be one of the selected videos that sometimes show up in search. Google decides what should and shouldn’t trigger a video result, and usually shows them when a video would make sense, for example when someone asks ‘how to’ or searches for ‘cute’ or ‘funny’ things.</p><p>There’s a bit of trial and error involved as there is no YouTube keyword tool to find video result keywords… yet. But you can use Google to search your keywords and see if they are video result keywords. Just type them in, and if a video appears in the listings below, you’ve discovered a video result keyword that is well worth optimizing for.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-how-to-add-custom-thumbnails-to-your-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, How To Add Custom Thumbnails to Your YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ips-for-handling-numerous-youtube-clips-concurrently/"><u>[New] Tips for Handling Numerous YouTube Clips Concurrently</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-distinguishing-between-youtube-policies-and-cc-clauses/"><u>[Updated] Distinguishing Between YouTube Policies and CC Clauses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-harness-the-web-to-preserve-and-share-live-music-sounds/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Harness the Web to Preserve and Share Live Music Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-swiftly-freeze-action-in-your-iphone-photography-journey/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Swiftly Freeze Action in Your iPhone Photography Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-top-9-camera-extras-for-professional-level-vlogging-on-smartphones/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 9 Camera Extras for Professional-Level Vlogging on Smartphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-why-are-my-insta-vids-upside-down-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Why Are My Insta Vids Upside Down, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-unveiling-the-process-of-identifying-youtube-audience/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiling the Process of Identifying YouTube Audience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ual-journey-to-crafting-a-user-friendly-subscribe-link-for-2024/"><u>A Visual Journey to Crafting a User-Friendly Subscribe Link for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/factory-reset-apple-iphone-se-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>Factory Reset Apple iPhone SE | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-webex-microphone-functionality-this-year/"><u>How to Restore Webex Microphone Functionality This Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/immersive-overwatch-review-where-competitive-spirit-meets-enjoyable-play/"><u>Immersive Overwatch Review: Where Competitive Spirit Meets Enjoyable Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-effortless-audio-extraction-best-youtube-to-mp3-tools-list/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Audio Extraction Best YouTube to MP3 Tools List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-spoofing-life360-how-to-do-it-on-oppo-k11-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Spoofing Life360 How to Do it on Oppo K11 5G?

The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.</p><p>In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.</p><p>Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.</p><p>There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention.

Interaction with your audience also builds a strong following. You can nurture a community by responding to comments, particularly if one of the viewers asks a direct question. Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/most-watched-youtube-video-in-24-hours-2.png"                      alt="get more views on youtube - actively engage with follower"                ></p><h4 id="Use-Other-Social-Channels-to-Get-More-Views-3"><a href="#Use-Other-Social-Channels-to-Get-More-Views-3" class="headerlink" title="- Use Other Social Channels to Get More Views"></a>- Use Other Social Channels to Get More Views</h4><p>Let the followers on your other social channels know every time you upload new video on your YouTube channel.

You can share your opinion about the musician, their latest work or the video’s visual aspects. Obtaining the copyrights to the music video you would like to comment on is very important, because you may be forced to delete your reaction video if you don’t.</p><h3 id="2-Video-game-reactions"><a href="#2-Video-game-reactions" class="headerlink" title="2. Video game reactions"></a>2. Video game reactions</h3><p>Video games like Minecraft, Fortnite or Grand Theft Auto attract a lot of attention on YouTube, and if you are a fan of any of them you can easily react to the gameplay. Reacting to video games is only a good idea if your channel is dedicated to gaming, because otherwise, this reaction video idea may seem off-topic.</p><h3 id="3-React-to-video’s-comments"><a href="#3-React-to-video’s-comments" class="headerlink" title="3. React to video’s comments"></a>3. React to video’s comments</h3><p>YouTubers that already have thousands of followers need to keep coming up with new ways to engage their audience.

Opting to comment on the videos you made in the past can also help you avoid potential copyright complications.</p><h3 id="7-Record-reactions-of-elderly-people"><a href="#7-Record-reactions-of-elderly-people" class="headerlink" title="7.

Can someone tell me how to work on a sports video?”</em></p><p>As I read this query posted on a popular online forum, I realized that so many people out there find it hard to create a sports video. Well, unlike a standard video, working on a sports highlight video can be tough. This is because it needs a lot of editing and we need to handpick the right moments from hours of footage. Though, if you use the right tools, then you can easily work on highlight videos like a pro. In this guide, I will let you know how to create sports videos in a step by step manner.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Highlight Video vs. Skills Video</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Create a Sports Highlight Video?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Expert Tips for Creating Highlight Videos</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important"><a href="#Why-is-a-sports-highlight-video-and-why-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is a sports highlight video and why important?"></a>Why is a sports highlight video and why important?</h2><p>As the name suggests, a highlight video basically includes all the vital events of a game in a short duration of time. You can include the details of some players at the start or focus on a particular player as well. Besides that, a sports highlight video would have fast-forward, slow motion, and frozen clips to skip or focus on certain details.</p><p>A lot of times, people don’t have the time to watch the entire game, which can span for a couple of hours. Therefore, they can watch a sports highlight video that would include all the major events of the game and will let them enjoy their thrill in a few moments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sports-highlight-video.jpg"                      alt="Sports Highlight Video"                ></p><p>Besides that, if you are applying for a college&#x2F;academy or just want to showcase your skills, then you can consider making a sports video of an impressive game of yours. You can simply showcase a player and try to highlight their skills in the video.</p><h2 id="Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences"><a href="#Highlight-Videos-vs-Skills-Videos-the-Major-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences"></a>Highlight Videos vs. Skills Videos: the Major Differences</h2><p>While making a sports video, you might encounter two different types of content – a highlight video and a skills video. As I have mentioned above, a sports highlight video would include the shots of an actual game. You can either focus on the event of a single game or include clips from multiple games that were played in a genuine setup. If you want, you can highlight a particular player while making the video as well.</p><p>On the other hand, a skills video is mostly made to demonstrate the skills of a player and is not focused on the game. In fact, most of the skills videos are made outside of a real game setting. For instance, if you have mastered a skill or would like to demonstrate your game-related actions, then you can make a skills video. Some of these videos are also tutorial game-plays to teach others about a particular skill that they can master.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video"><a href="#Use-Excellent-Video-Editor-to-Make-a-Sports-Highlight-Video" class="headerlink" title="Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video"></a>Use Excellent Video Editor to Make a Sports Highlight Video</h2><p>If you want to come up with engaging and visually appealing highlight videos, then consider using a versatile video editor like <strong>Filmora</strong>.

You can just drag and drop the video to its interface or go to its Menu &gt; File &gt; Import Media to browse and load the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="Import Media File"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137202/26400" target="_top" id="2137202">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137202" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137202/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Step-2-Edit-the-Sports-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Edit-the-Sports-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Edit the Sports Video"></a>Step 2: Edit the Sports Video</h4><p>In order to create a sports highlight video, the first thing that people do is trim any unwanted part. Once the video is loaded, you can view it on the timeline of the interface. Now, go to the timeline and get the trim tool to manually select the part of the video you wish to trim. After selecting the desired fragment, you can trim the clip or just delete it by clicking on their respective icons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-1.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>In the same way, you can also split your video and make other changes in it. You can also include multiple videos together and include them in your timeline as well.</p><p>If you are including multiple videos, then make sure they have the same dimensions and aspect ratio. For this, you can select the video, right-click on the timeline, and click on the crop icon. Now, select the same aspect ratio for the entire video to keep it uniform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-2.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><p>Most of the game highlights that we see have different speeds for various sections. That is, some actions would be fast-forwarded while some would be in slow motion. To apply this, simply select the section in the timeline, right-click, and go to the Speed and Duration settings. This will open a dedicated interface from where you can change the speed of the sports video.</p><p>Apart from manually setting the speed, you can also take the assistance of the custom speed options that are available in the timeline tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-3.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Make-Advanced-Edits-in-your-Sports-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Make-Advanced-Edits-in-your-Sports-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make Advanced Edits in your Sports Video"></a>Step 3: Make Advanced Edits in your Sports Video</h4><p>With the user-friendly interface of Filmora, you can do some basic edits and make a sports highlight video in minutes. Though, if you want to focus on some parts and make more changes, then you can use its advanced options as well.</p><p>For instance, in a highlight video, we often wish to freeze certain frames. To do this, just select a frame and use the “Freeze Frame” option from the timeline tools. You can even set the duration to freeze the selected frame.</p><p>If you have included clips from different videos, then you can apply all kinds of transitions from Filmora. In the end, you can go to its edit options and choose to close gaps as well.</p><p>To give your video a uniform and aesthetically pleasing appeal, you can also add different overlays and effects on it from Filmora’s library.</p><p>Lastly, make sure that you added sound or voiceover to your video. You can add a sound from its library or import any other music file to it. Since highlight videos mostly have voiceovers, you add the same by visiting the Record &gt; Record Voiceover option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-sports-video-4.jpg"                      alt="Edit Sports Video"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format"><a href="#Step-4-Export-your-video-in-the-desired-format" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Export your video in the desired format"></a>Step 4: Export your video in the desired format</h4><p>That’s it! Once your sports highlight video is ready, you can export it in different formats. Just go to the Export option and select the location to save the video and a preferred resolution.

Approval of YouTube Channel for Live"></a>2. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live</h3><p>To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel’s YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:</p><p>Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the “Profile” icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the “YouTube Studio” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the youtube studio option"                ></p><p>Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen.

Hence, you would be able to live stream Google Meet meetings through your YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on get ting started option"                ></p><h3 id="3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet"><a href="#3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="3. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet"></a>3. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet</h3><p>Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.</p><p>Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the <strong>Google Meet live stream</strong> on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube"></a>Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube</h2><p>Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, you can start a live stream from Google Meet to YouTube. Check the following steps to execute the process:</p><p>Step1 To allow Google Meet sessions to live stream on YouTube, the Google Workspace admin must adjust some settings. To begin, log in to the “Admin Console” on the Workspace administrator account. Now go to “Apps” and access the “Google Workspace” option.</p><p>Step2 Afterward, click “Google Meet” and tap on the “Stream” option. Once done, click on the “Pencil” icon to open the Settings menu. Now enable the options “Let People Steam Their Meetings” and “Let People Use YouTube to Stream Meetings.” Once done with the changes, click on the “Save” button.</p><p>Step3 Make sure that the Google account attached to your YouTube channel is capable of live streaming. Once done, go to your YouTube channel and tap on the “Create” button. Afterward, hit the “Live” button.</p><p>Step4 Now enter your Google Meet session and click on the “Activities” option. From the Activities menu, select “Live Streaming.” Now a small menu will open for live-streaming settings. You can create a new event and add an event title. Make sure to choose the privacy options and desired language. Afterward, click on the “Start Streaming” option.</p><p>Step5 A small pop-up will appear that will tell you to remind your participants about live streaming. After reminding, click on the “Start” button. You can see the red “Live” button that will indicate to you the ongoing live-streaming session. Once you have concluded the live streaming by clicking on the “Stop Streaming” button, you can check the video analytics by visiting your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Easily-Record-your-Google-Meet-Live-Stream" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream"></a>Bonus Tip: Easily Record your Google Meet Live Stream</h2><p>Do you want to save your <strong>Google Meet live-stream session</strong>?

Approval of YouTube Channel for Live"></a>2. Approval of YouTube Channel for Live</h3><p>To conduct live streaming, you must receive approval from the YouTube channel. For this, you must access your channel’s YouTube Studio to perform the account verification. Now to activate and enable live streaming on your YouTube account, check the following steps:</p><p>Step1 Open your YouTube account and click on the “Profile” icon given at the top-right corner. After opening the Profile menu, click on the “YouTube Studio” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="choose the youtube studio option"                ></p><p>Step2 A new window will be displayed on your screen. From the left panel, select “Content” among other options. Under the section called “Live,” locate the “Get Started” option. Afterward, tap on the “Request” option and perform the verification steps for enabling live streaming. After 24 hours, you would get approval for live streaming on YouTube. Hence, you would be able to live stream Google Meet meetings through your YouTube channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stream-google-meet-to-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on get ting started option"                ></p><h3 id="3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet-1"><a href="#3-Connect-your-YouTube-Channel-to-Google-Meet-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet"></a>3. Connect your YouTube Channel to Google Meet</h3><p>Once you get approval for live streaming, you can connect the YouTube channel to your Google Meet account. If the Host Management option is disabled, anyone within the Google Meet session can start live streaming. Conversely, only hosts or co-hosts can begin live streaming if this option is activated. Moreover, the individual who is starting the live stream from Google Meet will get connected to his YouTube channel.</p><p>Furthermore, you should use the same email address to enter the Google Meet that is connected to your YouTube account. By using the same email address, you can ensure smooth live streaming of Google Meet sessions to your YouTube channel. Also, you can only use laptops or desktops for initiating live streaming. The reason is that the <strong>Google Meet live stream</strong> on YouTube is not currently available on mobile devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082536/7443" target="_top" id="2082536">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082536" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082536/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-from-Google-Meet-to-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube"></a>Part 2: How to Live Stream from Google Meet to YouTube</h2><p>Once you have fulfilled all the requirements, you can start a live stream from Google Meet to YouTube.

Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant"></a><strong>1. Think of ‘Trending’ as Relevant</strong></h2><p>Instead of thinking of a trending video as a video that everyone is doing, think of it as a subject that is relevant to a lot of people. You want to cover topics that a lot of people care about.</p><p>A lot of YouTubers see huge channels have a lot of success posting videos that are very focused on the personal life of the creator (i.e. ‘I had the WORST day’) or which have very vague or sensational titles (i.e. ‘The horse knows what it did’) and decide that those are the kinds of videos they want to do too. However, the only reason large channels are able to be successful with these kinds of videos and titles is that they are already big. These creators have already grown themselves huge audiences of people who know and are interested in them personally.</p><p>As a smaller creator, you will not be successful if you only aim to do videos that are focused on you and your life. For example, if you have 100 subscribers and make a vlog about how your day went, then you have 100 people who may potentially find that interesting.

Every genre on YouTube has its own trends, and you will often know about them just by virtue of watching other channels in your genre and talking to people who are interested in the same things as you. For example, if you’re a Gamer and your friends are also Gamers then you probably already know what Gamers are currently interested in.</p><p>If you do need help determining trends, here are 2 ways to do it:</p><ol><li>Visit 3 of the most popular channels in your genre (i.e. gaming, beauty, or prank) and see if there’s any overlap in the themes of their most recent videos.</li><li>Go to <a class="link"   href="https://trends.google.ca/trends/" >Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and look at the categories most relevant to your genre. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >To learn how to use Google Trends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Aim-for-Number-1"><a href="#3-Aim-for-Number-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you know what’s popular in your genre then that will enable you to ask yourself ‘what’s on-trend, but not being covered yet?’.</p><p>For example, if you know that relationship videos – topics like ‘how do you know a guy likes you?’ – are doing well then you can think about what other aspects of dating people might be interested in that don’t have many videos on them yet. If you’re one of the first to tackle something that’s on-trend you have a much better chance of getting that number 1 search engine ranking, and higher ranked videos always get more views.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136614/26400" target="_top" id="2136614">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136614" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136614/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Success-Doesn’t-Mean-Making-a-Viral-Video"><a href="#4-Success-Doesn’t-Mean-Making-a-Viral-Video" class="headerlink" title="4.

The truth is that having one or two viral videos probably won’t help you much. People don’t subscribe to one video, they subscribe for consistently good content.</p><p>It’s much better to have 10 videos on a popular topic that are doing alright than it is to have that one big viral hit. Those 10 videos will consistently bring in new viewers to your channel who are more likely to subscribe because they can see you have other content they’re interested in.</p><h2 id="5-The-Subscriber-Snowball-Effect"><a href="#5-The-Subscriber-Snowball-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5.

If someone enjoys one of your videos on that topic and can see there’s another right there in the related videos, there’s a good chance they’ll click on it.</p><p>This gets you more views on multiple videos, and more subscribers because it builds the expectation that you’re going to continue to keep covering relevant topics. Having viewers click from video to video on your channel also increases your watch time, which YouTube’s algorithm takes as a sign that they should rank your videos higher in search results (getting you even more views).</p><p>Do you have any of your own tips for how to get a YouTube video trending?</p><p>Finding the trend is integral for YouTube channel growth.

As long as you have some reliable subscribers leaving comments on your videos you should be able to schedule a live stream and know it will have an audience. People feel a personal connection with their favorite vloggers so if you give your subscribers a chance to interact with you in real time they will probably plan to join in. The key to a good live streaming is to respond to comments and questions from people who are watching. Besides watching the live chat of your video you can create a hashtag for your stream and monitor it on twitter.</p><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Why Livestream?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Type of Content to Livestream</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>What You Need to Livestream On YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part5"><strong>8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part6"><strong>How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube</strong></a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Livestream"><a href="#Why-Livestream" class="headerlink" title="Why Livestream?"></a>Why Livestream?</h2><p>You have grown your audience, and now you want to take your channel to the next level and diversify your content.</p><p>Whether you are vlogging, gaming, or running tutorials on YouTube, there is potential to host a live broadcast. It’s not limited to any genre, you simply need to create content that people are interested in watching.</p><p>Before we get started into the How, let’s start with a few reasons Why you should be live streaming your content.</p><h4 id="Connect-and-engage-with-your-audience"><a href="#Connect-and-engage-with-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="Connect and engage with your audience"></a>Connect and engage with your audience</h4><p>When a viewer leaves a comment during a livestream you will be able to see it right away and respond. Having an instantaneous conversation with a viewer while they are watching your video will encourage more engagement and establish a ber relationship with your viewers — and you will know that these viewers are not bots.</p><h4 id="Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel"><a href="#Increase-watch-time-and-session-watch-time-on-your-channel" class="headerlink" title="Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel"></a>Increase watch time and session watch time on your channel</h4><p>If you are making YouTube videos on average 10 minutes long, and the viewer only watches half of it, that’s only 5 minutes of watch time, which is fine… But if you are live streaming for 45 minutes, and you are able to hold the viewer’s attention, you can surpass what your regular videos can do.</p><h4 id="Make-videos-faster"><a href="#Make-videos-faster" class="headerlink" title="Make videos faster"></a>Make videos faster</h4><p>As a YouTuber, you are always striving to be more efficient. Live streaming allows you to do that as you can set up and go. The content you end up creating during the duration of your livestream can then also be condensed into a highlight reel or a recap.</p><p>With a bit of planning before you go live, you can create a week’s worth of content in one go, instead of having multiple schedules for livestream content and your standard publishing videos.</p><h2 id="Type-of-Content-to-Livestream"><a href="#Type-of-Content-to-Livestream" class="headerlink" title="Type of Content to Livestream"></a>Type of Content to Livestream</h2><p>Live streaming has a lot of value, but what type of content should you be streaming?</p><p>Here are a few popular ideas for content that will attract viewers to your livestream:</p><h4 id="Q-A-session"><a href="#Q-A-session" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A session"></a><strong>Q&amp;A session</strong></h4><h4 id="Unboxing"><a href="#Unboxing" class="headerlink" title="Unboxing"></a><strong>Unboxing</strong></h4><h4 id="Game-or-challenge"><a href="#Game-or-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Game or challenge"></a><strong>Game or challenge</strong></h4><h4 id="Sneak-preview-or-review"><a href="#Sneak-preview-or-review" class="headerlink" title="Sneak preview or review"></a><strong>Sneak preview or review</strong></h4><h4 id="Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it"><a href="#Live-events-just-make-sure-the-Internet-can-support-it" class="headerlink" title="Live events (just make sure the Internet can support it)"></a><strong>Live events</strong> (just make sure the Internet can support it)</h4><h4 id="A-demo-or-a-tutorial"><a href="#A-demo-or-a-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="A demo or a tutorial"></a><strong>A demo or a tutorial</strong></h4><h4 id="A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video"><a href="#A-live-commentary-or-if-you-are-a-gamer-Let’s-Play-video" class="headerlink" title="A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video"></a><strong>A live commentary or (if you are a gamer) Let’s Play video</strong></h4><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105883/7443" target="_top" id="2105883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Livestream On YouTube"></a>What You Need to Livestream On YouTube</h2><h4 id="A-Plan-or-Outline"><a href="#A-Plan-or-Outline" class="headerlink" title="A Plan or Outline"></a>A Plan or Outline</h4><p>It’s good to know what your livestream is going to be about before you start. Is there a key message you want to hit, an action you want your viewers to take, or a structure you want to follow.</p><p>Just because it’s live, doesn’t mean it all has to be improvised. If you go in without a plan, you might end up feeling flustered or getting stressed out. Allow for spontaneous comments or events to take you off your initial plan, but always return to your outline so you know how to wrap up your livestream when you have to.</p><h4 id="Stable-Internet-Connection"><a href="#Stable-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="Stable Internet Connection"></a>Stable Internet Connection</h4><p>You cannot conduct a quality livestream, if your Internet is bad. When evaluating your internet connection for live streaming on YouTube, look at the Upload speed. Depending on the quality of your video, these are the minimum upload speed rates your Internet will need to perform:</p><p>480p &#x3D; 1.5 mbps</p><p>720p &#x3D; 3 mbps</p><p>1080 &#x3D; 5 mbps</p><p>In addition, be aware of external causes that may be slowing down your internet such as someone else using it, a poorly performing router, or a damaged cable.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p>If you have a smartphone or a laptop with a webcam built in, that is the best camera for you to get started live streaming. It’s good to have a milestone and work towards a more advanced camera, but until then, don’t feel discouraged because you don’t have expensive gear. If you have a smartphone, a laptop, or a basic webcam, that’s perfectly fine.</p><h4 id="Microphone"><a href="#Microphone" class="headerlink" title="Microphone"></a>Microphone</h4><p>You don’t need a great microphone for live streaming, you only need a good one. If you do want to spend several hundred to a thousand dollars for a professional studio microphone, nobody will stop you, but know this, a mic that is easy to use is as important as the audio quality as you develop a consistent live streaming schedule.</p><h4 id="Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#Streaming-Software-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>Streaming Software (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>Once upon a time, to livestream on YouTube, you needed additional software to capture content from desktop, camera, microphone, etc, called encoding software — but not anymore.</p><p>Those encoding software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wirecast <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >VMix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are required if you are producing content that requires a high frame rate such as gaming, but not mandatory if you are simply vlogging or running a tutorial.</p><p>If you are using Chrome, you can<a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/youtube-rolls-out-a-new-feature-that-lets-you-go-live-from-the-desktop-without-an-encoder/" >stream live on YouTube without using an encoder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams"><a href="#A-Capture-Card-For-Higher-Quality-Streams" class="headerlink" title="A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)"></a>A Capture Card (For Higher Quality Streams)</h4><p>You will need a capture card when you are capturing footage from a different PC or console. If you are a gamer and you are using one PC to stream and one PC to play your game, then you should consider getting a capture card.</p><h2 id="4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube"><a href="#4-Ways-to-Setup-Your-Livestream-On-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube"></a>4 Ways to Setup Your Livestream On YouTube</h2><p>There are 4 main ways you can start live streaming on YouTube. The one that works best for you depends on the content you are going to be streaming.</p><h4 id="1-Camera-Go-Live-Chrome-Browser"><a href="#1-Camera-Go-Live-Chrome-Browser" class="headerlink" title="1. Camera&#x2F;Go Live (Chrome Browser)"></a>1.

This way is best for a simple Q&amp;A or letting your viewers know your thoughts in a timely situation. This method does not require an encoder.</p><p> There are 3 ways to access livestream this way:</p><p>1. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/webcam"><strong>here</strong></a> to connect to your YouTube channel</p><p>2. You can access it from the top menu on YouTube</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/access-livestream1.jpg"                      alt="access livestream"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135375/19272" target="_top" id="2135375">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135375" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135375/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>3. You can access it by clicking Camera under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio</p><h4 id="2-Google-Hangouts-On-Air-Quick"><a href="#2-Google-Hangouts-On-Air-Quick" class="headerlink" title="2. Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)"></a><strong>2. Google Hangouts On Air (Quick)</strong></h4><p>Another way to livestream without an encoding software is by using the Google Hangouts On Air feature.</p><p>This is great if you want the feel of your livestream to be similar to a board meeting, where you can invite people, split screen, and share screen to illustrate your point.</p><p>Here’s how you can access this Google Hangouts On Air:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Events under the Live Streaming tab in your Creator Studio</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click New Live Event button on the top right corner</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-live-event-button2.jpg"                      alt="new live event button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the event’s Info and Setting page.

Mobile"></a><strong>3. Mobile</strong></h4><p>Live streaming via your mobile device gives you a lot more freedom to maneuver. You can walk around and give your viewers a tour — but remember to stay within the WiFi or LTE range. That means you still won’t be able to livestream well inside an elevator.</p><p>Here’s how you can livestream on mobile:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Access the YouTube app and make sure you are signed in to the account you want to livestream from.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: At the top, click on the camera icon</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on Go Live</p><p>  <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When live streaming, always hold your smartphone horizontally. This allows your video to be oriented as a landscape, instead of a portrait.</p><h4 id="4-Custom-Encoder"><a href="#4-Custom-Encoder" class="headerlink" title="4. Custom Encoder"></a><strong>4. Custom Encoder</strong></h4><p>The fourth way of live streaming on YouTube is with encoding software. This is the recommended method if video quality is essential, such as gaming videos.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download and install an encoding software. In this example, we’ll be using <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/" >OBS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Open OBS</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Go to YouTube Creator Studio and enter the Stream Now page</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-creator-studio4.jpg"                      alt="youtube creator studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Under Encoder Setup, copy Stream name&#x2F;key (Warning: DO NOT share this key with anyone)</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Return to OBS and enter the Setting menu on the lower right-hand side of the application</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click into the Stream tab</p><p>a) Under Stream Type, select Streaming Services</p><p>b) Under Service, select YouTube&#x2F;YouTube Gaming</p><p>c) Under Server, select Primary YouTube ingest server</p><p>d) In Stream Key box, paste the Stream Key you copied from YouTube</p><p>e) Click Apply and then OK</p><p><strong>Step 7</strong>: Plug in your webcam</p><p><strong>Step 8</strong>: In the main OBS dashboard, under the Sources menu, click the + icon and add Video Capture Device. You should now see visuals from your Webcam.</p><p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Select the Resolution you want for your video and click OK</p><p><strong>Step 10</strong>: Return to your YouTube Streaming Page and fill out the details of your livestream</p><p><strong>Step 11</strong>: Go back to OBS and click Start Streaming</p><p><strong>Step 12</strong>: See on YouTube Streaming Page at the top that you are Live. You are officially streaming. Once You are finished streaming, return to OBS and click Stop Streaming to end the stream.</p><h2 id="8-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Livestream-on-YouTube"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Livestream-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube"></a>8 Tips to Improve Your Livestream on YouTube</h2><h4 id="Do-Speed-Test"><a href="#Do-Speed-Test" class="headerlink" title="Do Speed Test"></a>Do Speed Test</h4><p>Before you start your livestream, do a speed test of your Internet. Check out from <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><h4 id="Have-Good-Lighting"><a href="#Have-Good-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="Have Good Lighting"></a>Have Good Lighting</h4><p>Be aware of your surroundings when you are about to livestream. You don’t need the top-notch lighting kit, you can simply sit beside a window and allow natural lights to illuminate your stream.</p><h4 id="Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted"><a href="#Shoot-A-Live-Test-Unlisted" class="headerlink" title="Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)"></a>Shoot A Live Test (Unlisted)</h4><p>Have a technical rehearsal by doing a livestream test, then rewatching it, and evaluating the quality of the audio and visual.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about your audience logging in and seeing your test if you set the Privacy of the stream to Unlisted.</p><h4 id="Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen"><a href="#Look-at-the-Lens-Not-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Look at the Lens, Not the Screen"></a>Look at the Lens, Not the Screen</h4><p>If you are streaming with the selfie camera on your smartphone or using your camera’s viewfinder to make sure you are in the frame, remember that you need to be looking at the lens — not the image of yourself.</p><p>Eye contact is important in building trust, and if you are looking at yourself, it will appear as if you are looking past your viewers instead of at them.</p><h4 id="Show-It-To-Your-Viewers"><a href="#Show-It-To-Your-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="Show It To Your Viewers"></a>Show It To Your Viewers</h4><p>Whatever you are talking about, if you can, show it to your viewers. YouTube is a visual medium, and that means your viewers can become disinterested if there’s nothing visual holding their attention.</p><p>In the beginning, you probably won’t have a multi-camera setup, so you cannot cut away from your livestream. However, you can share the screen and you can bring physical objects into a frame.</p><p>If you are talking about your dog, show her on camera. If you’re presenting something with a lot of steps, create a Powerpoint slideshow.</p><p>Consider what visuals or props you can add to your livestream to enhance your performance.</p><h4 id="Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen"><a href="#Find-A-Way-to-Make-it-Evergreen" class="headerlink" title="Find A Way to Make it Evergreen"></a>Find A Way to Make it Evergreen</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2012/10/16/guide-to-evergreen-content-marketing" >Evergreen content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>refers to content that is relevant for a great length of time. Talking about an event isn’t evergreen, because the event will soon pass and become old news. However, giving some tips for how to plan an event would be evergreen content.</p><p>Since your livestream will be saved on YouTube and your viewers can replay and watch it. They’re more likely to enjoy it if the content is relevant and interesting.</p><h4 id="It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long"><a href="#It-Doesn’t-Have-to-Be-Long" class="headerlink" title="It Doesn’t Have to Be Long"></a>It Doesn’t Have to Be Long</h4><p>A livestream doesn’t need to be 40 minutes long. It only needs to be long enough for you to get your story across — and if you want to answer some questions and engage with your audience. As soon as your story is over, even if it’s only 5 minutes, that’s okay. Don’t stress about the length of your stream, it’s not an endurance competition.</p><h4 id="Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes"><a href="#Allow-Yourself-to-Make-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes"></a>Allow Yourself to Make Mistakes</h4><p>Another thing you shouldn’t worry about at all is making mistakes. When you are doing livestreams pretend you are engaging with someone in real life. In real life, you aren’t able to edit out your mistakes, whether it’s a word mispronounced or coffee spilling. Roll with it and laugh it off.</p><h2 id="How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube"><a href="#How-to-Grow-As-A-Livestreamer-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube"></a>How to Grow As A Livestreamer on YouTube</h2><h4 id="Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming"><a href="#Let-People-Know-When-You-Are-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="Let People Know When You Are Streaming"></a>Let People Know When You Are Streaming</h4><p>Give people enough time to schedule it in, don’t spring it on them in the last minute. Share it on social media, your website, and any other means.</p><h4 id="Create-a-Streaming-Link-2-Days-Before"><a href="#Create-a-Streaming-Link-2-Days-Before" class="headerlink" title="Create a Streaming Link 2 Days Before"></a><strong>Create a Streaming Link 2 Days Before</strong></h4><p>Share your livestream link via social media to remind everyone to tune in when you go live.

Choosing the best camera lens for your YouTube channel can be tricky because there are so many options. This article will walk you through some of them, and make two recommendations of great vlogging lenses. If you already have a good understanding of how camera lenses work then feel free to scroll down to the lens recs.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-Lenses-Zoom-lens-Fixed-lens-aperture-f-stop"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-Lenses-Zoom-lens-Fixed-lens-aperture-f-stop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop"></a>Part 1. Understanding Lenses: Zoom lens, Fixed lens, aperture, f-stop</h2><p>There are two main categories of camera lenses: ‘zoom’ – lenses that allow you to zoom in and out – and ‘fixed’. If your lenses are tools then zoom lenses are Swiss army knives; they are very versatile. Fixed lenses, also called prime lenses, have more specific purposes. Do you need a tool that can do a lot of things, or a tool that is perfect for one specific job? Sometimes it is useful to have access to both.</p><p>We have explained the differences between Fixed lens and Zoom lens and advantages of using each lens, check this article: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zoom Lens vs. Fixed Lenses: Which one is best for YouTuber? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for the detailed information.</p><p>Before we get into the recommendations here is a little background information on lenses in general:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144310/7443" target="_top" id="2144310">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144310" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144310/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Beginner’s-Guide-to-Aperture-and-F-Stops"><a href="#Beginner’s-Guide-to-Aperture-and-F-Stops" class="headerlink" title="Beginner’s Guide to Aperture and F-Stops"></a>Beginner’s Guide to Aperture and F-Stops</h3><p>In order to be able to select the lens you’ll be using to record your YouTube videos, you first need to understand a few very basic concepts, such as aperture or f-stops.</p><h4 id="1-What-is-a-lens’s-aperture"><a href="#1-What-is-a-lens’s-aperture" class="headerlink" title="1.What is a lens’s aperture?"></a>1.What is a lens’s aperture?</h4><p>The aperture of your lens is the hole through which light reaches your camera’s sensor, or the film if you are using a film camera. The wider your aperture is the more light you are letting into your camera. In low light it is better to have a wide aperture, and when you are working with a lot of light it is better to have a narrow aperture so your footage is not overexposed.</p><p><strong>Aperture</strong> is simply an opening in the lens that lets the light through. If you want to increase the amount of the light that is reaching the camera’s sensor you need to open up the aperture blades that are located in the lens. The <strong>f-values</strong> like f&#x2F;1.2 or f&#x2F;1.8 indicate that the aperture is wide open and that the camera is receiving the maximum amount of light a lens you’re using can provide.</p><h4 id="2-What-is-an-‘f-stop’"><a href="#2-What-is-an-‘f-stop’" class="headerlink" title="2.What is an ‘f-stop’?"></a>2.What is an ‘f-stop’?</h4><p>Light passes through your lens’s aperture on its way to your camera’s sensor, and the f-stop of your lens relates to the amount of light it lets in. The lower your f-stop, the wider your aperture, and the more light you are letting into your camera. The more light you let into your camera the easier it is to achieve a blurred background. A lot of vloggers love blurring their backgrounds because it is a quick way to disguising the rooms they are shooting in.</p><p>F-stops are written like ‘f&#x2F;1.8’ or ‘f&#x2F;4’ on your lens. For more information on f-stops and blurring your background read “The Best Bokeh Lens - How to Get the Blurred Background for YouTube Videos” and watch Tasha’s video.</p><p><strong>F-stops</strong> or f-numbers indicate how open the aperture is, so for example if your camera is displaying f&#x2F;32 value it means that your camera is letting very little light to get through to the camera’s sensor. The f-number depends on a few other parameters such as shutter speed, exposure or ISO values. Large apertures provide a shallow depth of field which creates a smooth and artistic background blur, while a small aperture enables you to keep both the background and the foreground of your shot in focus.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Camera-Lenses"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Camera-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses"></a>Part 2: Types of Camera Lenses</h2><p>The visual aspect of a video may not be the only thing you’ll have to dedicate special attention to while recording your YouTube video, but it is surely one of the most important factors of the video production process. A lens you are using will largely contribute to the aesthetics of the video. That’s why you need to know which type of lens will deliver the best results when shooting different types of scenes. Here are some of the most common types of lenses you’ll encounter.</p><h4 id="Standard-lenses"><a href="#Standard-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Standard lenses"></a>Standard lenses</h4><p>These lenses are featured in almost all camera kits, so the chances are that if you have a DSLR camera you already have a standard, mid-range lens. These lenses commonly have a fixed 50mm focal length, although zoom lenses with focal lengths in the range between 35mm and 75mm are also considered standard. You can use them to capture medium shots, single or multiple figure shots, and in some cases establishing shots, because they offer enough versatility to cover a multitude of different scenes. Standard lenses often have large apertures, which makes them quite useful if you often shoot videos under light conditions you can’t control.</p><h4 id="Macro-lenses"><a href="#Macro-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Macro lenses"></a>Macro lenses</h4><p>Details, product shots or any other subject that can be filmed from close proximity looks better if they are recorded with macro lenses. The high contrast and sharpness these lenses provide allow you to create stunning close-ups of all hosts, guests or actors in your YouTube videos. What’s more, if you are presenting a new product to your audience you can use the macro lens to make some captivating shots that will attract more audience. Zoom lenses can also be used for macro photography and video, although prime macro lenses produce better results.</p><h4 id="Telephoto-lenses"><a href="#Telephoto-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Telephoto lenses"></a>Telephoto lenses</h4><p>The subjects of your videos don’t always have to be in your immediate surroundings, because telephoto lenses let you capture scenes that are several miles away from you. Wildlife or sports videographers frequently use telephoto lenses because they don’t have another way of getting close to their subjects. However, telephoto lenses with 70-300mm focal length can also be used to take stunning portraits or close up shots. The biggest downside of telephoto lenses is their weight because the lenses with higher focal lengths can weigh up to 10lbs, which makes them a bit inconvenient to always carry with you.</p><h4 id="Wide-angle-lenses"><a href="#Wide-angle-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Wide-angle lenses"></a>Wide-angle lenses</h4><p>Recording videos of vast open spaces, breathtaking vistas or beautiful city views is much easier if you have a wide-angle lens. The short focal length allows the lens to have a wider field of view which covers more space than standard or telephoto lenses. Wide-angle lenses also have lower apertures than lenses with longer focal lengths which results in images that have a shallow depth of field. Ultra-wide lenses like fisheye distort the view so the videos recorded with these lenses often suffer from the lack of realism.</p><h4 id="Specialist-lenses"><a href="#Specialist-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Specialist lenses"></a>Specialist lenses</h4><p>YouTubers who are working on demanding projects can try to solve their troubles by using a specialist lens. Soft-focus lenses can help you take better portraits while tilt-shift lenses allow you to control the perspective. However, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which you’ll need a specialist lense if you are just starting out since even experienced videographers only use special lenses when they have absolutely no better way to record a scene.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938750/19272" target="_top" id="1938750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938750/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Recommended-Best-Camera-Lenses-for-Shooting-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Recommended-Best-Camera-Lenses-for-Shooting-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos"></a>Part 3: Recommended Best Camera Lenses for Shooting YouTube Videos</h2><p>Here are a couple great lenses that might be good fits for you and your YouTube channel.

Like most STM lenses, it offers incredibly <strong>fast autofocus technology</strong> that makes it a great choice for fast-paced action videos. The lens is equipped with an <strong>image stabilization system</strong> which guarantees that your videos are going to remain <strong>sharp</strong> even if the camera wasn’t perfectly still while you were recording. Somewhat smaller aperture range makes this lens <strong>poor choice for low light scenes</strong>, although you can get decent results if you manage to keep the camera still.</p><h4 id="2-Rokinon-8mm-Ultra-Wide-f-3-5-Fisheye-Lens"><a href="#2-Rokinon-8mm-Ultra-Wide-f-3-5-Fisheye-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2.

Rokinon 8mm lens allows you to <strong>adjust focus and aperture manually</strong> so you can fine-tune your shot before hitting the record button. To make things even better this model is <strong>compatible with a wide range of cameras including Pentax, Canon or Nikon DSLRs.</strong> It has a relatively <strong>fast aperture</strong> that enables it to deliver <strong>solid performances under low light conditions</strong>.</p><h4 id="3-Canon-EF-50mm-f-1-8-STM-Lens"><a href="#3-Canon-EF-50mm-f-1-8-STM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="3.Canon EF 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-STM-Lens/dp/B00X8MRBCW/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=cd09588b67ac10e4e960ea45c87b3f06&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slotNum=4" >Canon EF 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec01.JPG"                      alt="camera lens"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915865/19272" target="_top" id="1915865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915865/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The EF 50mm is a fixed lens with an f-stop of 1.8, which means it is great for blurring your background and performs well even in poorer lighting conditions. This is a really great lens for an opinion or beauty vlog, where you do not need to move around. You can stay put right where the focus is sharpest and stand out by blurring everything behind you. If you tend to reuse the same sets then you do not really need a zoom feature. If your shooting conditions rarely change then it is just as easy to use a reliable fixed lens like the EF 50mm since you will not need to be rethinking your set up and adjusting.</p><p>If you are looking for an inexpensive prime lens that lets you create sharp videos with shallow depth of field, you should look no further. This model is one of three Canon’s 50mm prime lenses, although the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Standard-Medium-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00009XVCZ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-3&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=11bff1019e73f0462c30a04e98d4874f&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTe" >50mm f&#x2F;1.4 USM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-Lens-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000I1YIDQ/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1438974280&sr=8-4&keywords=Canon+50+mm&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=d77bb813550f12e8aa72c8738dfaad81&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoYz.LvcTeAiw&slot" >50mm f&#x2F;1.2 ‘L’ USM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> models are much more expensive. You can use it to record a lot of different types of YouTube videos, like product reviews or makeup tutorials. The 50 mm f&#x2F;1.8 STM lens doesn’t have image stabilization technology so you should try to be as still as you can possibly be when shooting handheld videos in order to avoid recording footage that has a lot of camera shakes.</p><h4 id="4-Canon-EF-135mm-f-2L-USM-Lens"><a href="#4-Canon-EF-135mm-f-2L-USM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="4.Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-135mm-USM-Lens-Cameras/dp/B000053HC5/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&qid=1439038618&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+EF+135mm+f/2+L+USM+Lens&linkCode=sl1&tag=omnideals-20&linkId=3ef39fe6c476b0dab7cf573810e16103&linkCode=w61&imprToken=ZJIXM-O6nkoY" >Canon EF 135mm f&#x2F;2L USM Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Recording <strong>moving objects</strong> from a distance requires you to have a lens that allows you to smoothly track their movements while keeping the subject in focus. The Canon EF 135mm f2&#x2F;L USM lens is perhaps one of the best telephoto lenses on the market because it uses L glass that is widely accepted as the best in the industry. The Canon’s telephoto lens is compatible with ASP-C and Full Frame EF mount cameras. Keep in mind that this is also a prime lens and you can’t increase or decrease its focal length, but even so, it is a perfect choice for documentary-style videos.</p><h4 id="5-Tamron-SP-AF-17-50mm-f-2-8-XR-Di-II-LD-Aspherical-IF-Lens"><a href="#5-Tamron-SP-AF-17-50mm-f-2-8-XR-Di-II-LD-Aspherical-IF-Lens" class="headerlink" title="5.Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Tamron-17-50mm-Aspherical-Canon-Cameras/dp/B000FZ3FY8" >Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f&#x2F;2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical (IF) Lens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camera-lens-rec02.JPG"                      alt="camera lens rec02"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The Tamron’s standard zoom lens offers good value at a very reasonable price. The maximum aperture is f&#x2F;2.8, while the minimum aperture value this lens supports is f&#x2F;32, which means that its users can easily experiment with different <strong>depths of field.</strong> The lens is <strong>compatible with most Canon cameras</strong> so if you have a camera from another manufacturer you may have to use the lens adapter in order to mount it onto your camera. Like most standard zoom lenses, Tamron SP AF model is <strong>highly versatile</strong> and you can use it to record <strong>a wide range of different scenes</strong>.</p><p>A lot of zoom lenses do not have wide enough apertures to create blurred backgrounds, but this Tamron lens is an exception at f&#x2F;2.8. This low f-stop also means that it performs better in poor lighting conditions than a lot of other zoom lenses. If your shooting conditions change a lot – if you often change locations, for example – then it will be good to have a sturdy, well-built, zoom lens like the AF 17-mm that can be quickly adapted to new angles and distances.</p><h4 id="6-Sony-30mm-f-3-5-Macro"><a href="#6-Sony-30mm-f-3-5-Macro" class="headerlink" title="6.Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro"></a>6.<a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/791322-REG/Sony%5FSEL30M35%5F30mm%5Ff%5F3%5F5%5FWide%5FAngle%5FLens.html" >Sony 30mm f&#x2F;3.5 Macro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>All Sony’s APS-C format E mount cameras are compatible with this multi-purpose lens. When mounted the 30mm lens provides a 45mm focal length equivalent, which means that you can use it to take macro shots of products or to record medium or close-up shots. This is a prime lens, so changing the focal length isn’t really an option, but the 1:1 life-size magnification, as well as the 0.9-inch working distance, allow you to get close to the subjects in the video. The aperture range is between f&#x2F;3.5 and f&#x2F;22 which means that you can choose how shallow the depth of field in your shot should be.</p><p>If you are using a 4k camera to shoot your YouTube video, check out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best camera lens for 4k professional production. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-10-best-free-live-streaming-apps-for-android-and-iphone/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 10 Best Free Live Streaming Apps for Android and iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/elve-into-discussions-of-dedicated-viewers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Delve Into Discussions of Dedicated Viewers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-easy-efficient-and-essential-top-23-tools-to-downgrade-youtube-audios-for-2024/"><u>[New] Easy, Efficient, and Essential Top 23 Tools to Downgrade YouTube Audios for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-enthralling-epics-essential-channel-building-tactics/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enthralling Epics Essential Channel-Building Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/n-2024-learn-quickly-youtube-audio-to-high-quality-mp3-on-mac-os/"><u>[New] In 2024, Learn Quickly YouTube Audio to High-Quality MP3 on Mac OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/n-2024-safe-methods-transforming-youtube-audio-into-mp3-files-efficiently/"><u>[New] In 2024, Safe Methods Transforming YouTube Audio Into MP3 Files Efficiently</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-step-in-making-the-most-of-snap-camera-in-microsoft-teams/"><u>[New] Step-In Making the Most of Snap Camera in Microsoft Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/nravel-time-on-your-screen-fresh-perspectives-to-watch-youtube-backwards/"><u>[New] Unravel Time on Your Screen Fresh Perspectives to Watch YouTube Backwards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/87043713-updated-in-2024-free-tribe-50-branding-banners-ready-to-unleash/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Free Tribe 50 Branding Banners Ready to Unleash!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-harmonious-hub-choosing-the-best-free-apps-for-your-youtube-music-streams/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Harmonious Hub Choosing the Best Free Apps for Your YouTube Music Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-simplify-crafting-effective-youtube-subscription-buttons/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Simplify Crafting Effective YouTube Subscription Buttons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-your-complimentary-access-to-50-premium-youtube-banners/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Your Complimentary Access to 50 Premium YouTube Banners!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-leading-emulators-top-5-for-playing-ps3-games-on-pc-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Leading Emulators Top 5 for Playing PS3 Games on PC for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/approved-kitchen-combatants-30-pugnacious-food-show-titles/"><u>2024 Approved Kitchen Combatants 30 Pugnacious Food Show Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/wmvmov-movavi/"><u>免費在線WMV到MOV格式改換 - 以 Movavi 為解決方案</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/effortless-win-11-screen-captures-here-for-2024/"><u>Effortless Win 11 Screen Captures Here for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-simple-and-effective-ways-to-change-your-country-on-youtube-app-of-your-motorola-moto-g13-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Simple and Effective Ways to Change Your Country on YouTube App Of your Motorola Moto G13 | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
