Beeps are all titled ‘Beep’, but nothing else is really labeled beyond being called ‘Interface Sound’. You just have to listen and find out.</p><p> <strong>Machines:</strong>  a variety of different machine sounds can be found here, from power tools like chainsaws and drills to things like typewriters or paper shredders.</p><p> <strong>Mechanical:</strong>  this is where you’ll find sounds associated with cameras, coin slots, zippers, and more.</p><p> <strong>People:</strong>  laughing, clapping, footsteps and even farts – this is where you’ll find human sounds.</p><p> <strong>Transportation:</strong>  these sounds are all related to vehicles, be they cars or airplanes.</p><p> <strong>Voices:</strong>  here you’ll find voices saying common things like ‘hi’, ‘aaah’, or ‘come on’.</p><p> <strong>Music:</strong>  PacDV also has a selection of royalty free music.

Sound Gator"></a>5. Sound Gator</h4><p>Sound Gator has a huge number of sound effects divided into too many categories to list (24). The categories tend to be very specific, like ‘drink sound effects’ or ‘phone sound effects. If you don’t see a category that sounds like what you’re looking for, make sure to check under Misc Sound Effects because there are 68 Mp3#s in there for everything from tools to static.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/soundgator-free-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Sound Gator Free Sound Effects"                ></p><p>You can sort the sound effects on Sound Gator by date added, popularity, top rated, runtime, top favorites, or most discussed.</p><h4 id="6-Sounds-Crate"><a href="#6-Sounds-Crate" class="headerlink" title="6. Sounds Crate"></a>6. Sounds Crate</h4><p>Sounds Crate is part of the larger Production Crate which provides all kinds of resources to creators for free (you can upgrade to a paid account to access exclusive content, but there’s a lot of great content available for free). The categories available on Sounds Crate are:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/soundscrate-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Sounds Crate Sound Effects"                ></p><p> <strong>Ambient:</strong>  room tones and general background noises from nature or cities.</p><p> <strong>Animal:</strong>  includes things like puppy barks and angry cats.</p><p> <strong>Blades and Metal:</strong> you’ll find sounds from swords, chains, and other metal implements here.</p><p> <strong>Crashes and Debris:</strong>  perfect for action, this is where you’ll find sounds associated with destruction.</p><p> <strong>Electricity:</strong>  things like electrical blasts and charges can be found here.</p><p> <strong>Electronics:</strong>  any sound made by anything electrical, like beeps and appliance sounds.</p><p> <strong>Explosions and Bangs:</strong>  if you have a visual explosion effect, you’ll probably need to combine it with something from here.</p><p> <strong>Fight:</strong>  find sounds associated with action sequences, like whooshes and punches.</p><p> <strong>Gun Related:</strong>  everything from reloads to gunshots.</p><p> <strong>Impact:</strong>  any kind of thud or shattering sound.</p><p> <strong>Lock n’ Load:</strong>  although there are some ‘gun checking’ sounds in here, it’s mostly clothing related sounds like zippers and Velcro.</p><p> <strong>Movement:</strong>  wind sounds and whooshes.</p><p> <strong>People:</strong>  sounds humans make, from voices to footsteps.</p><p> <strong>Sci-Fi SFX:</strong>  zaps, beeps, and sci-fi ambience.</p><p> <strong>Vehicle:</strong>  includes both common vehicles like cars and less-common vehicles like tanks.</p><p> <strong>Weapons:</strong>  both modern weapons like missiles and old-timey things like arrows.</p><h4 id="7-Zapsplat"><a href="#7-Zapsplat" class="headerlink" title="7. Zapsplat"></a>7. Zapsplat</h4><p>Zapsplat claims to be the fastest growing free sound effects library on the internet. With more than 23,999 professional sounds, and more being added every week, they might just be right. The owner of the site, Alan McKinney, adds 500 sound effects every week by himself and the site also accepts sounds from contributors. All of their sounds were recorded using professional equipment and then edited to make them perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zapsplat-sound-effect-categories.jpg"                      alt="Zapsplat Crate Sound Effect Categories"                ></p><p>You can even send Alan a message and request specific sound effects if you can’t already find what you want on the site.</p><p>On Zapsplat you can browse 26 categories including fantasy, warfare, and animals for individual sounds. Or, you can visit the Free SFX Packs section and download a set of related sounds together. Packs include ‘Magic Wand’, ‘Science Fiction Alarms’, and ‘Cartoon Boings’.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-Your-Own-Sound-Effects-for-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Make-Your-Own-Sound-Effects-for-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Make Your Own Sound Effects for YouTube Videos"></a>Part 2: Make Your Own Sound Effects for YouTube Videos</h2><p>Here are some easy ways you can make your own sound effects at home.</p><h4 id="1-Making-Natural-Sounds"><a href="#1-Making-Natural-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="1. Making Natural Sounds"></a>1. Making Natural Sounds</h4><p> <strong>Fire</strong>  using cellophane. Just crinkle the cellophane wrap to create a sound like a crackling fire. Chip bags work too.</p><p> <strong>Rain</strong>  using rice. Sprinkle rice (or birdseed) onto a thin metal sheet.</p><p>Alternatively for rain, you could record the sound of bacon frying.</p><p> <strong>Wind</strong>  using a Ziploc. Fill a large ziplock with air and then open the bag a bit and force the air out.</p><p> <strong>Thunder</strong> with aluminum. Just shake a sheet of aluminum to make a thunder sound.</p><h4 id="2-Making-Action-or-Sci-Fi-Sounds"><a href="#2-Making-Action-or-Sci-Fi-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="2. Making Action or Sci-Fi Sounds"></a>2. Making Action or Sci-Fi Sounds</h4><p> <strong>Ticking Bomb</strong>  with a clock. Any clock that ticks will do.</p><p> <strong>Hits&#x2F;Blows</strong>  with a pillow. Hit a pillow to make a sound like a body blow. For really hard hits, you might want to whack a sofa cushion with a broomstick.</p><p> <strong>Bones breaking</strong>  with celery. Just snap the celery stalks in half.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-supercharge-your-game-trailers-with-keywords/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Supercharge Your Game Trailers with Keywords</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-affordable-minecraft-video-graphics/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Affordable Minecraft Video Graphics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/droid-comparison-youtube-app-explored/"><u>IOS/Android Comparison  YouTube App Explored</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-transform-flv-into-youtube-hits-with-these-top-alternatives/"><u>In 2024, Transform FLV Into YouTube Hits with These Top Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/24-the-path-to-vr-storytelling-editing-and-streaming-360-video-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, The Path to VR Storytelling  Editing and Streaming 360° Video on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/-platforms-at-a-glance-comparing-vimeo-and-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Video Platforms at a Glance  Comparing Vimeo & YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/outube-subscriber-boost-the-4-simplest-tricks-to-grow-your-channel-faster/"><u>[New] YouTube Subscriber Boost – The 4 Simplest Tricks to Grow Your Channel Faster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unleash-cinematic-quality-top-rated-1080p-video-editing-tools/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Unleash Cinematic Quality Top-Rated 1080P Video Editing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-every-story-prime-video-editor-apps-for-android/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Every Story  Prime Video Editor Apps for Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-zooming-your-tiktok-videos/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Zooming Your TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/avoidance-tactics-no-more-recommended-podcasts-on-spotify-for-2024/"><u>Avoidance Tactics  No More Recommended Podcasts on Spotify for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/enhancing-macs-live-performance-with-mixer/"><u>Enhancing Mac's Live Performance with Mixer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-8-best-apps-for-screen-mirroring-vivo-y36i-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, 8 Best Apps for Screen Mirroring Vivo Y36i PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-simulate-gps-movement-in-ar-games-on-oppo-reno-11-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Simulate GPS Movement in AR games On Oppo Reno 11 Pro 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-new-to-video-editing-here-are-15-free-and-easy-to-use-options/"><u>New 2024 Approved New to Video Editing?

When you’re a part of a crowded platform like YouTube, having a logo definitely helps to differentiate yourself from all the other channels. In this article, we’ll be going over the top nine resources online for making YouTube logos for free.</p><ol><li><a href="#pixlr">PIXLR EDITOR</a></li><li><a href="#getpaint">GETPAINT</a></li><li><a href="#canva">CANVA</a></li><li><a href="#designevo">DESIGNEVO</a></li><li><a href="#logomakr">LOGOMAKR</a></li><li><a href="#fotor">FOTOR</a></li><li><a href="#snappa">SNAPPA</a></li><li><a href="#logaster">LOGASTER</a></li><li><a href="#cooltext">COOLTEXT</a></li></ol><h2 id="1-PIXLR-EDITOR"><a href="#1-PIXLR-EDITOR" class="headerlink" title="1. PIXLR EDITOR"></a>1. PIXLR EDITOR</h2><p>PIXLR Editor is a powerful free online design tool that looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. If you’re going to design your YouTube Logo this way though, you’re going to have to design it from scratch.</p><h2 id="2-GETPAINT"><a href="#2-GETPAINT" class="headerlink" title="2. GETPAINT"></a>2. GETPAINT</h2><p>GETPAINT.NET is very much like PIXLR in that it looks and feels a lot like PhotoShop. But with GETPAINT.NET, you’re going to have to download it and run it from your computer to be able to use it.</p><h2 id="3-CANVA"><a href="#3-CANVA" class="headerlink" title="3. CANVA"></a>3. CANVA</h2><p>Unlike PIXLR and GETPAINT.NET, where you’ll have to design your logo from scratch, Canva comes with a lot of customizable design elements, stock images, and filters you can choose from. Canva is a simpler design tool. You won’t be able to work with layers or add effects to your text.</p><h2 id="4-DESIGNEVO"><a href="#4-DESIGNEVO" class="headerlink" title="4. DESIGNEVO"></a>4. DESIGNEVO</h2><p>Similar to Canva but even simpler and more focused on simple logo making is Designevo.</p><h2 id="5-LOGOMAKR"><a href="#5-LOGOMAKR" class="headerlink" title="5. LOGOMAKR"></a>5. LOGOMAKR</h2><p>Logomakr is quite similar to Designevo but it allows you to work with layers.</p><h2 id="6-FOTOR"><a href="#6-FOTOR" class="headerlink" title="6. FOTOR"></a>6. FOTOR</h2><p>Fotor is similar to Canva. Although you get less premade text templates, you can at least add a drop shadow to your text.</p><h2 id="7-SNAPPA"><a href="#7-SNAPPA" class="headerlink" title="7. SNAPPA"></a>7. SNAPPA</h2><p>Snappa is also a great online tool similar to Canva and Fotor.</p><h2 id="8-LOGASTER"><a href="#8-LOGASTER" class="headerlink" title="8. LOGASTER"></a>8. LOGASTER</h2><p>For those wanting an even simpler option, one that automatically designs several different options for you simply based on your brand name and activity that your brand is involved in, Logaster is a good tool for that. Logaster will supply with you many different design options. You might find one that you like.</p><h2 id="9-COOLTEXT"><a href="#9-COOLTEXT" class="headerlink" title="9. COOLTEXT"></a>9. COOLTEXT</h2><p>Cooltext is a simple free website that gives you a library full of different text styles. You first choose the style that you want to customize and then replace the text. You can save your selection as a png and upload it into any of the other online design tools previously mentioned above.</p><p>If you want free templates that will work with a lot of these logo makers, check out our post on <a class="link"   href="https://www.filmora.io/community-blog/youtube-profile-picture-templates-%E2%80%93-free-downloads%21-310.html" >YouTube Profile Picture Templates - Free Downloads! <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Have you ever used a YouTube logo maker?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/he-essential-guide-to-using-finalcut-pro-in-youtube-editing/"><u>[New] The Essential Guide to Using FinalCut Pro in YouTube Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-mastery-of-gamers-channel-graphics-with-template-use/"><u>[Updated] Mastery of Gamers' Channel Graphics with Template Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ngs-on-youtube-the-crucial-number-of-video-views-for-money/"><u>Earnings on YouTube  The Crucial Number of Video Views for Money</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-resetting-your-youtube-reputation-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Resetting Your YouTube Reputation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/astery-of-removal-eliminating-downloaded-youtube-clips-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastery of Removal  Eliminating Downloaded YouTube Clips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-understanding-the-economics-youtubes-new-model-for-content-creators-and-viewers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Understanding the Economics  YouTube's New Model for Content Creators and Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-vloggers-money-saving-camera-recommendations/"><u>[Updated] Vloggers' Money-Saving Camera Recommendations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-screen-capture-in-google-video-conferencing/"><u>Navigating Screen Capture in Google Video Conferencing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-honor-magic-vs-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Honor Magic Vs 2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-assessing-the-usefulness-of-instas-verified-posts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Assessing the Usefulness of Insta’s Verified Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-breaking-into-fame-the-ultimate-tiktok-hit-list-for-2024/"><u>[New] Breaking Into Fame  The Ultimate TikTok Hit List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/watermark-free-videos-how-to-remove-filmora-branding-with-or-without-paying-for-2024/"><u>Watermark-Free Videos How to Remove Filmora Branding with or without Paying for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-you-transfer-files-from-poco-c50-to-iphone-151413-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can You Transfer Files From Poco C50 To iPhone 15/14/13? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-vivo-v29e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>9 Mind-Blowing Tricks to Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking On Vivo V29e | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/how-to-unleash-funimate-with-apk-on-your-phone/"><u>How to Unleash Funimate with APK on Your Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fixes-for-apps-keep-crashing-on-vivo-x100-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fixes for Apps Keep Crashing on Vivo X100 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you are a YouTuber who does a lot of singing videos, this is definitely an affordable microphone to check out.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> This microphone, perhaps primarily designed for karaoke, has an echo feature that, although might create new dimensions to your vocals, may not be desired for your YouTube video. This feature can be problematic, as it could spoil your recording.</p><h4 id="TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93"><a href="#TAKSTAR-SGC-598-26-93" class="headerlink" title="TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93"></a><strong>TAKSTAR SGC-598 - $26.93</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a condenser microphone, and it can be fixed onto your camera, which simplifies your YouTube setup. This camera can plug directly into your camera, reducing the audio tracks you need to manage when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/takstar-sgc-598.jpg"                      alt="takstar-sgc-598"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> The camera-mounted microphone has a shock-resistant design that reduces noise when the camera is moved. The cardioid microphone will be able to pick up audio in the direction it is pointed in, reducing noise capturing from behind the camera. This is a good microphone for vlogging or interviews.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The TAKSTAR SGC requires one AA battery, so you’ll have to remember to carry a backup every time you film.</p><p>Limited to a vocal subject standing 4-5 feet away, any more and the microphone will be hard-pressed to pick up the audio without capturing a lot of surround audio.</p><p>The design requires it to be mounted to the camera. If you want to separate it from the camera and still have it recorded, a bit of creativity is required to keep it standing.</p><h2 id="YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100"><a href="#YouTube-Microphones-for-Under-100" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Microphones for Under $100"></a><strong>YouTube Microphones for Under $100</strong></h2><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><h4 id="Behringer-C-1U-59-99"><a href="#Behringer-C-1U-59-99" class="headerlink" title="Behringer C-1U - $59.99"></a><strong>Behringer C-1U - $59.99</strong></h4><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-C-1U-BEHRINGER/dp/B001QXCYZY/" >Behringer C-1U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a condenser microphone with a cardioid pickup pattern that connects to your computer via USB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/behringer-c-1u.jpg"                      alt="behringer-c-1u"                ></p><p><strong>Pro:</strong> This microphone has a solid metal build and has a good weight.

Simply connect it to the computer, and you are ready to record your voice. It captures clear and crisp audio for a single voice or single-person recording.</p><p><strong>Con:</strong> The range of this microphone is not that great; you’ll have to be close and be speaking directly into the microphone to get the best audio.

It has a plug-and-play setup and doesn’t require any drivers or installations. It records great instrumentals and would recommend it to those who are recording music for YouTube.</p><p><strong>Con</strong>: May pick up extraneous noises if you are recording vocals while there are movements in your surrounding, but otherwise, this is an excellent microphone in its price range.</p><h2 id="Final-Thoughts"><a href="#Final-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p>When looking for microphones under $100, the difference in audio quality is not going to be drastic. What you need to consider is how you are going to be using this piece of equipment.</p><p>If your YouTube videos consist of you in a quiet studio environment, I would recommend the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Marantz-Professional-MPM-1000U-Microphone-Podcasting/dp/B01GHOM67W/" >Marantz Professional MPM-1000U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>However, if you will be recording on the go and require your hands to be free in the scene, I recommend getting a lavalier microphone such as the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Panda-Lavalier-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B01MSKI46R" >Purple Panda <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But, if you are going to be recording other people, in addition to yourself, I’d say go with the <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/TAKSTAR-SGC-598-Interview-Microphone-Camcorder/dp/B00E58AA0I" >TAKSTAR SGC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it will give you more audio control in busy environments.</p><p>What are you looking for in a budget microphone?

When you have chapters for your YouTube video, each chapter will have an individual preview. Chapters will break your YouTube video into multiple parts allowing your audience to have better context and information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-chapter.jpg"                      alt="YouTube video chpater"                ></p><p>As per YouTube, chapters let the audience navigate better through videos. Chapters will let your audience watch different video parts, which will eventually lead to better engagement. If you want to organize your YouTube content, chapters are one of the best ways to go about it. By using labeled timestamps, your video will be divided into multiple sections. Your audience will be able to see the preview of the content and easily skip to the part they want to see within the video’s progress bar.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Chapter-to-YouTube-Video-Progress-Bar"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Chapter-to-YouTube-Video-Progress-Bar" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Chapter to YouTube Video Progress Bar?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Chapter to YouTube Video Progress Bar?</h2><p>If you are a YouTube creator and want to know how you can add chapters to your YouTube content, here’s what you need to do. Follow these instructions carefully:</p><p>Step 1: First things first, please sign in to your YouTube account.</p><p>Step 2: Select the video that you want to edit and add chapters.</p><p>Step 3: Click on the edit video option. This option will be there under the video.</p><p>Step 4: On the add details page, you will see the description box. Here, you need to add the list of titles and timestamps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-chapter-youtube-description.jpg"                      alt="add YouTube video chpater"                ></p><p>Please keep in mind that you must add the first timestamp with “00:00”. You will have to add a minimum of three timestamps with a minimum of 10 seconds for each chapter. Here is how it looks like in the description after published.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-chapter-description-appearance.jpg"                      alt="Chapters in YouTube video description"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Why-YouTubers-Should-Add-Chapters-to-videos"><a href="#Part-3-Why-YouTubers-Should-Add-Chapters-to-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Why YouTubers Should Add Chapters to videos?"></a>Part 3: Why YouTubers Should Add Chapters to videos?</h2><p>There are two primary advantages of adding chapters to your YouTube videos. Apart from making your YouTube video look organized and neat, chapters will let you provide a better user experience to everyone watching your video because they will find all the information about your video faster and easier within a video. And the second benefit is that your YouTube video will show up in search results. This is a way to optimize your content for more users to find your content.</p><p>YouTube chapters are beneficial for both creators and viewers. On the progress bar, these clickable chapters can be added. This will allow a viewer to skip and scrub through a video quickly and skip to parts they actually want to watch.</p><p>This feature is quite helpful for videos that are pretty long. Chapters will let you segment the videos into important chapters so that the viewer can rewatch already watched chapters or skip to other chapters in the video. YouTube chapters have been recently added to this platform for better navigation and engagement.</p><p><strong>Better User Experience for Users</strong></p><p>Just like Google wants browsers to find what they are looking for when they add a keyword, YouTube also wants to help viewers find what they are looking for. Chapters can be immensely beneficial for extended content. For example, if you are uploading a video of your convert video, let the users jump straight to their favorite songs.</p><p>Even in tutorial video content, viewers will now have a chance to get straight to the main part of the video. With chapters being added, viewers will have an opportunity to decide whether they want to watch the whole video or not. They won’t have to keep skipping one part to another blindly. Chapters will allow them to find what they are looking for in an instant.</p><p><strong>For Creators: Increased Visibility</strong></p><p>If you know about the Google algorithm, you must be aware that it regularly changes its algorithm to let people find the information they are looking for easily. Adding chapters to your video will encourage Google to display them more often when someone searches for them, and this will include adding your videos to its featured snippets.</p><p>While adding chapters, you need to make sure that it is labeled with correct keywords, and it is clear and descriptive. YouTube videos are often showed as Google snippet when someone tries to find something on the search engine. Adding a chapter will let Google understand the content better, thereby letting your videos gain more search traffic.</p><h2 id="Part-4-When-should-I-add-or-not-chapters-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-4-When-should-I-add-or-not-chapters-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: When should I add or not chapters on YouTube?"></a>Part 4: When should I add or not chapters on YouTube?</h2><p>If you are wondering whether all videos on YouTube should have chapters, the answer to this is no. A two minutes long video won’t require chapters because it won’t make sense. Think about whether you would want your audience to have reduced watch time. Another thing to pay attention to is audience retention.</p><p>We mentioned earlier that adding chapters to long videos will be a good idea, but before you jump in and start adding chapters, you need to understand whether it will help you and should be done in your particular case?</p><p>If you are uploading a video on education, science and technology, how-to, news and politics, Q and A, and other similar videos, adding chapters will definitely help. In these kinds of videos, you will let your audience rewatch a section they liked the most over and over again.</p><p>However, if you are uploading music, entertainment, comedy, and film and animation videos, we will recommend not to add chapters because this will reduce the watch time.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Do-YouTube-Video-Chapters-Decrease-Channel-Watch-Time"><a href="#Part-5-Do-YouTube-Video-Chapters-Decrease-Channel-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Do YouTube Video Chapters Decrease Channel Watch Time?"></a>Part 5: Do YouTube Video Chapters Decrease Channel Watch Time?</h2><p>One of the most commonly asked questions regarding adding chapters to YouTube videos is whether it will reduce the watch time of a video. Video chapters are a pretty good feature and can enable your videos to engage with the viewers.</p><p>Since chapters allow your audience to skip through video content, they are not really watching the whole video, which can’t be suitable for audience retention! Here’s what we have to say to this: don’t put your 100% focus on watch time right now. Your focus should be creating informative and engaging content, which will keep your audience hooked to their screens. Even if you add chapters, if your audience doesn’t find it engaging, they will choose not to go on with the content.</p><p>Video chapters are a tiny part of the overall content. Chapters provide value to your audience, and you should try them. If you are uploading a concise video, animation video, funny video, and more, don’t add chapters.</p><p>Even some of the most watched videos on YouTube have chapters. Learn from them. These video makers could have thought about numbers rather than giving value to their audience, but they did just the opposite, and here they are with over a million views!</p><h2 id="Part-6-Tips-for-adding-chapters-to-YouTube-video"><a href="#Part-6-Tips-for-adding-chapters-to-YouTube-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Tips for adding chapters to YouTube video"></a>Part 6: Tips for adding chapters to YouTube video</h2><p>Each video on YouTube is different, and that’s why there is no one-size-fits-all answer. There are some cases where you should not think about adding chapters at all. Whereas in other cases, you will have to experiment a bit before adding chapters.</p><p>Here are some tips that will help you.</p><p><strong>Do Some Testing</strong></p><p>Before adding chapters to a new video that you are thinking to upload, try adding chapters to an old video. See what happens to that video. Have the views increased? How about average view duration? Track these metrics first, and then try adding chapters to your upcoming videos to benefit from videos. Along with these metrics, you will also have to evaluate if adding chapters decreases or increases the watch time and number of views.</p><p><strong>Label Your Chapters Using Keywords</strong></p><p>Another thing to do that will help you have better traction is using a good keyword strategy. Look at what people are using while searching for content, which is similar to yours? Using names based on keywords that have better search volume will help your videos to rank higher.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Why-Video-Chapter-is-Not-working-Problem-solved"><a href="#Part-7-Why-Video-Chapter-is-Not-working-Problem-solved" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Why Video Chapter is Not working?

From CPC to CPM, estimated gross earnings per view, and more. Keep reading to find out more about how these factors affect your YouTube earnings;</p><p><strong>CPM (Cost Per Mile):</strong> CPM is the amount an advertiser pays for every one thousand views of their ads. This means if an advertiser is paying you $10CPM, you’ll earn $10 on every 1000 views of their ads.</p><p><strong>CPC (Cost Per Click):</strong> Most people think CPC is the same as CPM, but no they are not. Cost Per Click is the amount an advertiser pays for every viewer that clicks on their ads. If an advertiser is willing to pay $10, then you’ll earn $10 on every ad click.</p><p><strong>Estimated Gross Earning Per Subscriber:</strong> You’ll notice whenever you watch a YouTube video, the creator always emphasizes you click the Subscribe button to get a notification on every new video he&#x2F;she uploads.

Even so, building your channel exclusively around <strong>reaction videos</strong> may prove to be difficult, but this doesn’t mean that you can’t use this type of video to comment on what other YouTubers are saying.</p><p>The process of <strong>making a YouTube reaction video</strong> is not overly technical, although you will have to decide which video editing technique you are going to use to make a reaction video. That is why in this article we are going to take a look at different ways to make a YouTube reaction video.</p><ul><li><a href="#pip_filmora">Method 1: Making Reaction Videos with PIP feature in Filmora</a></li><li><a href="#split_screen_filmora">Method 2: Create YouTube Reaction Video with Split Screen Templates</a></li><li><a href="#ai_portrait_filmora">Method 3: Make A Reaction Video for YouTube with AI Portrait</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Reaction-Video-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-3-Ways"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Reaction-Video-for-Your-YouTube-Channel-3-Ways" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Reaction Video for Your YouTube Channel?

Consequently, the selection of videos you can comment on is going to be limited, since it is entirely up to the creator of the video if they are going to give you permission to use their footage in your reaction video.</p><p>You can use the following video editing techniques, once you have access to the video you would like to comment on.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Making-a-reaction-video-with-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-in-Filmora"><a href="#Method-1-Making-a-reaction-video-with-the-Picture-in-Picture-feature-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Making a reaction video with the Picture-in-Picture feature in Filmora"></a>Method 1: Making a reaction video with the Picture-in-Picture feature in Filmora</h3><p>Video editing software, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, can also be used to create YouTube reaction videos, but you must have all the footage you would like to include in that video before you can start putting it together.</p><p>The first step is to create a new project in Filmora and then import the media assets into the editor. Besides video clips, you can also add music, pictures, or create opening titles and end credits for your reaction video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Place the video you’re reacting to on a video track on the timeline and then add the video of your reaction to the timeline that is directly above the one to which you added the first video clip. Click on the top video in the preview window and use the handles that are positioned around the edges of the video to adjust its size.</p><p>If you would like to change the on-screen position of the overlay clip, you should simply click on it and drag it to the new location within the preview window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-reaction-video-size-position.jpg"                      alt="Create reaction video with Filmora Picture in Picture feature"                ></p><p>Filmora offers more than sixty motion effects, hundreds of transitions, and visual effects that can make your reaction video more visually appealing to the audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compositing-video-9.jpg"                      alt="Filmora  compositing with Blending modes"                ></p><p>Moreover, Filmora video editing software offers a variety of blending modes, and it lets you control the opacity of the overlay video so that you can make it more transparent. Whether or not you are going to use these options depends on the footage you’re working with and the demands of a particular project.</p><p><strong>Pros of using the Picture in Picture feature to make reaction videos in Filmora:</strong> You can place and adjust the videos with more customizable options.

The only way to avoid being absolutely sure that your reaction video isn’t violating the law is to contact the video creator and ask for permission to use their intellectual property. However, most YouTubers are reluctant to let others download and edit their videos unless they already have a large fan base.</p><p>In case you’re granted permission to comment on a video, you have nothing to worry about. However, if you don’t get the permission you’re all the money the reaction video generates will go to the copyright owner or you will be forced to delete the video from your channel. There are still a few things you can do, even if you don’t get permission to use the video you would like to comment on.</p><p>Muting the video’s audio or altering its pitch will make it more difficult for YouTube’s bots to detect copyright infringement, although this method may not always work. In addition, you can play a video for up to thirty seconds, then comment on that segment, and then play another segment of that video.</p><p>There is no way of saying whether any of these editing tricks are going to help you avoid a copyright claim, and you should only use them if you have no other option.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Anyone can master the technical aspects of making a reaction video, but the topics you react to need to be related to the general topic your channel covers. What’s more, the idea of your reaction video has to be relevant for your audience if you want to attract their attention.

And, in this digitally oriented world, you’re left with no reason not to create a YouTube channel specifically when you have the right talent to use one. Well, this guide is for those who are already into YouTube video creation and now need help on how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong> as per different aspect ratios. According to YouTube’s aspect ratio, it’s the right place to move forward even if you want to resize your videos present on other social media apps. We know brands and other influencers generally practice this kind of social media marketing.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our session on resizing YouTube as per the ideal aspect ratio without further ado.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Right-Aspect-Ratio-of-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Right Aspect Ratio of YouTube Videos?</h2><p>For attracting more audience and increasing engagement on YouTube videos, you have to look at each factor, along with the YouTube video quality. And, you cannot overlook the size of YouTube video among these factors to make it your perfect shot among competitors. Considering the importance of such factors, we’ve come up with this specific section on introducing you to the correct aspect ratio for YouTube videos.</p><p>It’s crucial to know the size before you start the YouTube game!</p><p>YouTube allows you to upload videos of different sizes ranging from 240p to 8K. And, the dimensions for these different sizes are as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>240p:</strong> 426x240 pixels</li><li><strong>360p:</strong> 640x360 pixels</li><li><strong>480p:</strong> 854x480 pixels</li><li><strong>720p:</strong> 1280x720 pixels</li><li><strong>1080p:</strong> 1920x1080 pixels</li><li><strong>1440p:</strong> 2560x1440 pixels</li><li><strong>2160p:</strong> 3840x2160 pixels</li><li><strong>43200p:</strong> 7680×4320 pixels</li></ul><p>Along with these, the aspect ratio, video size, and length of YouTube video should also be taken into consideration while uploading YouTube videos.</p><p>Thus, the ideal aspect ratio to <strong>resize YouTube video</strong> is perfect as 16:9, which we’ll diversify in the following three sections.</p><p><strong>1. Computer</strong></p><p>On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for YouTube video is 16:9. And, the YouTube player will automatically adjust other aspect ratios than the standard size. For instance, it may add padding of white or gray color depending upon the theme. However, it’s advisable to avoid these things like padding as they interfere with YouTube’s dynamic adjustments.</p><p><strong>2. Android Phone</strong></p><p>In the Android application, the scenario is quite different from YouTube videos. The app automatically adjusts the player as per the video size. The video will always fit the screen, whether it’s square, vertical, or horizontal. Ultimately, the videos will be shorter for widescreen and square for vertical.</p><p><strong>3. iPad &amp; iPhone</strong></p><p>Similarly, the YouTube app for iPad and iPhone automatically adjust the video size to fit the screen. Thus, every video will fit the screen, even if it’s square, horizontal, or vertical.</p><p>Before we let you know how to <strong>resize YouTube videos</strong>, here are some tips for creating awesome YouTube videos.</p><ul><li>Create a strategy for YouTube video beforehand.</li><li>Search for ideas and topics.</li><li>Understand the use of the best equipment and gear.</li><li>Ensure the best YouTube video editing.</li><li>Optimize YouTube videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Automatically-Resize-YouTube-Videos-to-Right-Aspect-Ratio-with-Wondershare-Filmora-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac"></a>Part 2: Automatically Resize YouTube Videos to Right Aspect Ratio with Wondershare Filmora for Mac</h2><p>Hopefully, you have noted the correct aspect ratio required for YouTube videos.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Guide-for-Social-Media-Savvy-Content-Sharers"><a href="#Guide-for-Social-Media-Savvy-Content-Sharers" class="headerlink" title="Guide for Social Media Savvy Content Sharers"></a>Guide for Social Media Savvy Content Sharers</h2><p>YouTube has become the most popular video-sharing platform on the internet, with users from all over the world uploading and watching videos daily. You can find content on just about any topic you can think of on YouTube, making it an excellent resource for entertainment and education.</p><p>But what if you’ve created a playlist of your favorite videos and think your friends or family would enjoy it? To help you with this, we’ve put together an extensive guide on <strong>how to</strong> <strong>share a YouTube playlist</strong> on your computer and mobile devices.</p><p>So, let’s get started with our guide without any further delay!</p><h2 id="Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work"><a href="#Why-Doesn’t-The-Share-Function-In-The-Playlist-Work" class="headerlink" title="Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?"></a>Why Doesn’t The Share Function In The Playlist Work?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s figure out why the “Share” function doesn’t work. The “Share” function in the playlist does not work because it is set to “private,” and YouTube doesn’t allow you to share them. To fix this, you must first change the privacy settings of the playlist to “public” in the following way:</p><p>Step1 Head to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website using a browser on your PC and sign in to your account.</p><p>Step2</p><ul><li><strong>Click</strong> the three-line <strong>“Menu”</strong> icon at the top-left of your screen.</li><li>Go to <strong>“Library.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/changing-playlist-visibility.png"                      alt="changing playlist visibility"                ></p><p>Step3 Select your playlist labeled as <strong>“Private.”</strong> On the next page, click the <strong>“Private”</strong> option in the playlist details section and select <strong>“Public”</strong> to change the visibility of your playlist.</p><p>Once the privacy setting has been changed, the <strong>“share”</strong> function will work as intended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/making-youtube-playlist-public.png"                      alt="making youtube playlist public"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist"><a href="#How-To-Share-The-YouTube-Playlist" class="headerlink" title="How To Share The YouTube Playlist?"></a>How To Share The YouTube Playlist?</h2><p>If you want to share the playlist on YouTube using your computer or mobile device, read the instructions below carefully:</p><h3 id="1-For-Computers"><a href="#1-For-Computers" class="headerlink" title="1.

Here are the step-by-step instructions for achieving this task:</p><p>Step1 Visit the <strong>YouTube website</strong> using a browser on your computer and sign in to your account. Click your <strong>Profile</strong> in the top-right of the screen and select <strong>“Your Channel”</strong> from the drop-down menu, which will take you to your YouTube channel’s dashboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-youtube-channel-to-share-playlist.png"                      alt="accessing youtube channel to share playlist"                ></p><p>Step2 Next, go to the <strong>“Playlist”</strong> tab and click the <strong>“View Full Playlist”</strong> option under your playlist to access it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/sharing-own-youtube-playlist.png"                      alt="sharing own youtube playlist"                ></p><p>Step3 Finally, click the <strong>“Share”</strong> icon in the playlist’s details section, and a window will pop up.

Now, click the <strong>“Share”</strong> icon in the playlist’s details section, and a pop-up window will appear.
