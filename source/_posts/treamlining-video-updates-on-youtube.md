## Advanced Tips to Edit Uploaded/ Published YouTube Videos

It is true that YouTube Editor provides us a handy platform that allows us to edit existing YouTube videos in an efficient ways. However, the tools they provide are too basic. If you want to perform a more complex editing, you will need an offline editor such as Windows Movie Maker, iMovei or Adobe Premiere. But if you are looking for an simple while powerful tool, we highly recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is highly compatible with different image, audio, and video format. It is just as simple as importing the video and editing them.

The **downside**, however, is that you will lose the original ID of the video. This may serve as a problem if you have already shared the video before since the views may disappear. A good solution to this problem is to place an annotation to the old video telling your followers that you have created a better quality of the video then direct them to the link.

Check how to engage your audience to stay tuned from this video below:

## Edit Existing YouTube Videos

Let me walk you through a familiar situation, you spend all night trying to make your video perfect, uploaded it on your YouTube channel and shred it to your social media accounts. Then you noticed that you need to repair something. The normal approach back then is to delete the video, re-edit using offline tools and then re-upload it again. Clearly, this process takes too much time. Furthermore, it changes the ID of your video which means that the previous embed will no longer work.

**Note:** Under this situation, you can't add more footage or effects to the existing videos.

#### 1\. Sigin in

The first thing you need to do to edit uploaded/published YouTube videos is to sign-in with your Google account.

#### 4\. Save

After you are happy with your edited video, you can now click save.

Note: In case you are not happy with the video that you edited, you can always revert back to your original video. Videos with more than 1,000 views will be saved as a new video after the editing. You may also add notes and annotation to your Videos. This annotation may appear alongside with the video depending on the time that you want it to appear.
