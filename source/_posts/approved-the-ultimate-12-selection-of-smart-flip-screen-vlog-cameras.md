It is equipped with a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor, comes with the DIGIC 6 image processor, and shoots up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. For low lighting conditions, you can set the camera’s ISO to as high as ISO 25600. The 80D is great for autofocusing during video recording as it comes with a 45-point all cross phase detection autofocus system and a dual pixel CMOS AF system.  **PROS** _\- Feature-rich_ _\- Continuous AF feature performs beautifully while recording high-res videos_   **CONS** _\- Just one SD card slot_ _\- PC sync connection features could be better_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| ![Canon 6D Mark II](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlogging-camera-flip-screen-4.png) | Best professional DSLR camera with a flip screen for vlogging: Canon 6D Mark II The 6D Mark II is currently (at the time of writing this review) the only full-frame DSLR camera that comes with both a fully-articulated screen and a microphone jack. It is equipped with a 26.2 MP full-frame CMOS sensor, comes with the DIGIC 7 image processor, and shoots up to full HD 1080p videos at 60 fps. The 6D is also equipped with the same 45-point all cross-phase detection and dual pixel CMOS autofocusing system as the 80D. If you’re wanting to vlog with a full-frame camera, the 6D Mark II is the best option.  **PROS** _\- ISO sensitivity goes up to 102400_ _\- Amazing touchscreen controls_   **CONS** _\- No 4K video recording option_ _\- No USB 3.0_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
