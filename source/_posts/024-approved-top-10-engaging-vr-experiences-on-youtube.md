VR Videos YouTube – For VR Videos with the YouTube mobile app, you can watch VR videos alongside cardboard. You will have an immersive feeling while watching this as you feel present in the scene actions while having your field of vision covered with a viewing device.

Though both YouTube VR and 360 give an immersive viewing experience with 360-degree coverage, still YouTube 360 videos reflect live actions with modified cameras accessible through 360-degree video-compatible devices.

There are quite a good number of VR Headsets, but we have the option of choosing a high-quality VR headset that should be able to deliver a wonderful experience. This is what every user wants. Let's take a good look at a few of them.

### 1. **Oculus Quest 2**

This VR headset is top-notch. Its impressive flexibility, backed by its shocking price, will make one not want to look elsewhere.

No need to worry about screen-door effects as the headset possesses a high per-eye resolution—smooth 90Hz refreshing rate just like the Rift CV1 Oculus. Based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, XR2 resulted in excellent standalone performance. It's also capable of linking up with gaming PC for desktop experiences.

### 2. **PlayStation VR**

A lot of VR games have come out on PlayStation VR. The PlayStation VR gives PS4 users an excellent and quality experience. However, it doesn't have the highest resolution displays and cannot go for wild, room-scale tracking.

It has a 960 x 1,080 per-eye resolution and offers a 120Hz refresh rate for quality experiences. Its 100-degree field of view, motion controllers, and separate camera are suitable for unlocking immersive gameplay. A fantastic thing about it is that although it was for the PS4 and PS4 Pro, Sony ensured it'll also run on the PS5.

### 3. **HTC Vive Cosmos**

The HTC Vive Cosmos is the latest HTC headset in town. Overall combined 2,880 x 1,700 resolution provides optimally sharp resolution for the eyes that is 1,440 x 1,700.

This headset has an easy-to-wear halo-style headband and attached headphones for spatial audio. It's a highly versatile headset that allows users to switch which version of the Cosmos they're using by simply swapping out the faceplate, controllers, and any tracking base station.
