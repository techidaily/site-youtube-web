## Part 3: Why is Mr. Beast Trending on YouTube?

Mr. Beast is known for going above and beyond for his YouTube content. He also runs other YouTube channels, besides Mr. Beast, that are mainly based on Philanthropy, Gaming videos, Short Videos, etc that also account for his huge income. Some of the reasons why he is so successful are

**A Relentless amount of work and effort:**

Mr. Beast has put in a relentless amount of work and effort into his videos. He has been making videos at the age of 13.

Mr. Beast makes videos that are based on enduring challenges and cash prizes to the winners. The audience of his videos, the contestants specially, are those people who are in need of money or are low-paid workers, waiters and Uber Drivers etc.

**Engaging Videos:**

The most unique thing about Mr. Beast’s videos is that he has the least appearance in them. He mostly focuses on something that the viewers can engage with: the contestants, the unique and expensive video sets and the storyline. If you have to watch a video just to learn a way to earn a $100,000, won’t you do it?

Here’s the typical flow of a MrBeast video:

1. He introduces a challenge
2. He then explains the rules
3. He announces a reward (Cash/ Merchandise/ Car)
4. He then follows the contestants as they face the challenge
5. Lastly he gives the winner lots of money

**Skillfully Edited Videos**

Mr. Beast’s carefully crafted videos have a unique element of motion graphics throughout his video that not only make the video colorful and interactive. Moreover, each clip is only seconds long, which creates a fast yet exciting pace for his content, that makes you hooked to the video.

Have a look at his most viewed video that captured around 245 million views. It showcased a Real-life Squid Game challenge ![$456,000 Squid Game In Real Life!](https://youtu.be/0e3GPea1Tyg)

**Feel-Good Element**

You might have looked at the creative side of Mr. Beast uptil now, but he is also a very generous human. While helping people in terms of cash prizes, he donates most of his income to his family, friends, and charity.

The keen element of his video is to generate enough engagement that would help him spare the money for the poor, and that is what stands him out.
