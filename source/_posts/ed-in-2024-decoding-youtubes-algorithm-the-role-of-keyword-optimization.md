## Why Do We Need to Research YouTube Keywords?

Researching YouTube keywords is essential to your success. Here are three reasons why you might want to consider YouTube keyword research.

#### Helps You Know What Your Audience Is Searching for

Keyword research allows you to understand what people search for when they are on YouTube. In turn, this helps you know what your potential customers are seeking. You'll then include these terms on your content to increase the chances of your audience finding you on YouTube.

#### It Helps You Rank Higher

You can use YouTube videos to promote brand awareness and market your product. Having high-ranking videos is a cost-effective way to push your target audience through the sales funnel.

When creating YouTube videos, you need to ensure you are reaching your target audience. And that is why researching keywords is crucial.

Once you have performed YouTube keyword research and determined the most suitable keywords for your topic, you can now use them to create target content for your audience. In turn, this will help you increase the number of subscribers on your YouTube channel. Your chances of your video showing up on YouTube will increase, which will bring traffic to your business.

#### It's the Cheapest Way to Market Your Products or Services

Video marketing is expensive, and that is why you have to find every possible edge for your video marketing if you want to lower your costs and increase your ROI. For this reason, keyword research will ensure your audience finds you without spending loads of money that you could have used on services like Google Ads.

Because keyword research allows your target audience to find you, this means more opportunities for you. Most of the users will share entertaining videos.

## How to Research Keywords on YouTube?

There are several ways of conducting keyword research for YouTube to find out what people are searching for and determine the content in your video. They include:

#### 1\. Using YouTube Search

<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Although this method doesn't provide all available search options, it's still good for getting an idea of the type of keyword with which you're dealing.

You can start your research by typing the keywords into YouTube's search bar and reviewing the displayed results. It might be helpful to check out similar videos or video playlists. If your search seems too wide, you can enter several keywords at once (separated by commas), which will help you find better results.

#### 2\. Using Google's Keyword Planner Tool

If you only want to know the number of organic visits a given keyword gets, Google Keyword Planner might be helpful. The tool allows you to create lists consisting of related keywords and provides information about CPC (cost per click) and potential traffic in general.

#### 3\. Using YouTube Suggestions

What makes YouTube unique is its ability to suggest content based on your location, subscription, and watch history. You can use this method to find keyword ideas if you have subscribed to relevant channels. Also, you can rely on YouTube suggestions to find out whether a topic is popular or not.

#### 4\. Using YouTube Analytics
