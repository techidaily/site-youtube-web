To do this, capture a live photo by opening your camera app. Then click on the live photo icon, which is located in the upper right corner. And tap on the shutter button.

1. Afterward, you locate the live photo you want to convert to a loop video by going to the Photos apps. Then click on _Albums > Media Types> Live photos._
