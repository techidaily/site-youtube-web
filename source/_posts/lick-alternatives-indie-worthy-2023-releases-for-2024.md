Movie Watcher is another excellent Fmovie Alternatieves.

Move Watcher is unique because it allows users to see how well a film is produced and then decide what they want to do with that information. If you like binge-watching your favorite shows, you may also locate American TV shows at this FMovies alternative.

**Features:**

### 7.GoStream

![gostream-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gostream-poster.png)

GoStream, one of the best sites like FMovies, is the last entry on our list. As with the other sites described above, this one focuses on providing you with the most recent movies for free, with a preview and an IMDb rating for each one of them.

However, if you're looking for movies that were out in a certain year, your search may come up short. Streaming is as simple as clicking the "start" button when you see anything intriguing.

As a bonus, the videos load quickly and you don't need a username or password to begin watching. Only a few redirections are included in this site's advertising. Before you begin streaming, we suggest that you verify the quality of the movie, since some on the site are of low quality.

**Features:**

* One focuses on providing you with the most recent movies for free
* Videos load quickly and you don't need a username or password to begin watching
