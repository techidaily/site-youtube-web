Step 5\. Format your video. Remember that the entire video will be embedded. You don't necessarily need the whole video. It is time to select just a brief but relevant clip from the video to use. Then position your video to the right point using the axes from the exact starting point to the finished part you want the video to appear in.

#### Method 2\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by direct link

You can engage this method if you want to include the entire video.

Step 1\. Get the URL of the specific YouTube video that you want to use.

Note: You can do a few edits inside the application. Set the timer when your video should start and when to stop. You can also adjust the video player size.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.

Step 3\. It would be best if you now viewed the "YouTube" search bar to type in the video you want to embed. You can use keywords to search for the video in question and view instant search results.

Step 4\. Then select the video you want to embed, and you'll see it appear on the "Slide."

![how to add youtube video to google slides by search and selection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-3.png)

Step 5\. Format your video. Remember that the entire video will be embedded. You don't necessarily need the whole video. It is time to select just a brief but relevant clip from the video to use. Then position your video to the right point using the axes from the exact starting point to the finished part you want the video to appear in.

#### Method 2\. Embed YouTube video to Google Slide by direct link

You can engage this method if you want to include the entire video.

Step 1\. Get the URL of the specific YouTube video that you want to use.

![how to add youtube video to google slides by direct link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-4.png)

Step 2\. Then go to your browser's "Address bar" to copy the YouTube link.

Step 3\. Next, open the "Presentation" slide to put your video to.

Step 4\. Choose the "Insert" tab from the menu bar.

Step 5\. Then hit on the "Video" option from the drop-down menu that appears.

Step 6\. A new window will open automatically. Choose the "By URL" tab.

Step 7\. Then paste the YouTube video URL in the "Paste YouTube URL Here" bar section.

![add youtube video to google slides by direct link](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-youtube-video-to-google-slide-5.png)

Step 8\. Wait for the video file to load and press the "Select" option. The video will immediately appear in the presentation slide. Just drag and drop the video in your preferred position.

Note: You can do a few edits inside the application. Set the timer when your video should start and when to stop. You can also adjust the video player size.

## How to choose the right video for your Slides?

Not all videos will make an impact on your Google Slide. You need to use the best shot that adds value to your presentation. These guidelines will help you to settle on the best video.

**Be Professional** – choose the best video for your presentation. Remember that the video is part of the presentation and carries more weight. Settling for quality video will bring out the professionalism in you.

**Relevant** – how do you know that what you are showing your audience corresponds to the presentation piece? Ensure that the video you add has something to do with the Google Slide presentation topic. The two should naturally flow to make it easy to understand the whole concept.

**Precise** – your presentation is not about the video. The ideal length should not exceed 60 seconds. The longer the video, the greater the chance for your audience to lose track along the way.

**Know every footage you are working with** – this will help you pick the best shots for your presentation. So, learn every aspect of the video before settling down to use it.

**Add new content** – even though one content may suit several presentations, don't rely on the same piece each time. Your audience will want to feel something fresh each time you are presenting. So, compose different videos for different scenarios to make that big impact.
