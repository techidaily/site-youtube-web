## Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube

As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.

Here's what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:

| **Methods**                                        | **Viewers/Clicks/Impressions**                                     | **Earnings/Commission**                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube Ads $1 CPM**                             | 1 million Ad views                                                 | Average rate per ad=0.18Total \~ $5000 |
| **Brand Sponsorships**                             | 5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub                        | $300 $700 $950 $3500                   |
| **Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission**         | If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link. Total $2000 | $2000\*35%= $700                       |
| **Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5** | 100 subscribers funds the channel                                  | 100\*5=$500                            |
| **Merchandise Shelf $5 Shirt**                     | 100 subscribers purchases your merch                               | 100\*5=$500                            |
| **Channel Memberships $5/month**                   | 100 loyal subscribers join membership                              | 100\*5=$500                            |

### YouTube Ads

The video ads on the platform aren't lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.

### Brand Sponsorships

Brands can sponsor your videos to reach their target audience. YouTube videos are a big part of our lives, and brands are becoming increasingly aware of how useful these videos can be. To be eligible for sponsorship, your channel must be of 5000 subscribers.

### Affiliate Marketing

YouTubers help brands increase sales by encouraging their viewers to shop at the company's store or visit its specific product pages. They then earn a commission (30%-35%) on products that people buy after clicking an affiliate link.

### Merchandise Shelf

Your merchandise represents and feeds your audience's connection with you. Your product is your business, so you're first and foremost an entrepreneur. Then design your YouTube marketing strategy to sell your merchandise and generate income.

### Channel Membership

YouTube has a plan that allows you to charge your subscribers for membership on your YouTube channel. Members get access to exclusive live chats, badges, emojis, etc. Subscribers must give a set amount every month to a channel that makes a steady monthly income for YouTubers.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.

Some other factors, e.g., it's worth comparing the RPM of your country and other countries, different rules and prices of YouTube Ads depending on your country.

Part 1: The rules to know for each means earning money from YouTube

As a YouTube creator, finding ways to earn money from your content cannot be easy. Some creators make a living solely off their channels. Others supplement their income with affiliate marketing, sponsorships, and ad revenue. But if you want to earn money from YouTube truly, you need to understand which monetization methods work best for you and your content.

Here's what you should know when using each method and why you should consider doing so:

| **Methods**                                        | **Viewers/Clicks/Impressions**                                     | **Earnings/Commission**                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **YouTube Ads $1 CPM**                             | 1 million Ad views                                                 | Average rate per ad=0.18Total \~ $5000 |
| **Brand Sponsorships**                             | 5K Sub 5K-30K Sub 30K-500K Sub 500K-1M+ Sub                        | $300 $700 $950 $3500                   |
| **Affiliate Marketing 30%-35% commission**         | If 100 people buys $20 product through affiliate link. Total $2000 | $2000\*35%= $700                       |
| **Crowdfunding (Patreon, Indiegogo, GoFundMe) $5** | 100 subscribers funds the channel                                  | 100\*5=$500                            |

### YouTube Ads

The video ads on the platform aren't lucrative and can be used to supplement your income in the form of AdSense earnings. An actual advertiser pays 0.18 per ad view on average (as shown above). That means 1000 ad views equals $18 and $3-$5 per 1000 views.

### Brand Sponsorships

Brands can sponsor your videos to reach their target audience. YouTube videos are a big part of our lives, and brands are becoming increasingly aware of how useful these videos can be. To be eligible for sponsorship, your channel must be of 5000 subscribers.

Today many people use crowdfunding websites to raise money for personal, channel-related projects. Most YouTubers are doing it to generate steady cash flow. Some of them use this source to fund their YouTube videos so that it increases quality and engagement.

## Part 4: How much money can you make on YouTube?

The answer to that question can vary widely depending on the type of content you produce and the demographics of your target market. However, we've found that a single video ad can be worth anywhere from around $100 to $5,000.

It's safe to say that most YouTubers earn between $1,000 and $10,000 per month from their ads alone. But there are many other factors to take into consideration when calculating the money, you can make on YouTube:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The number of views your videos get

The key to making money from videos on YouTube is views. The more views you have, the more chance of getting paid will increase. So you need to create videos that will get viewers to click.

According to _Forbes's_ estimation, you can make $3-$5 per 1000 views. e.g., a video with 1,000,000 views can make around $5,000 on views only.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### The engagement level of your audience

When building a YouTube channel, the key to success lies in engaging with your audience. After all, if they don't like what you're offering, they will not watch your videos. So you've got to have a message that resonates and is useful.

### Your channel type

The YouTube algorithm is set up to favor channels with a high volume of views per video and high-quality content rather than low-quality channels that generate a lot of traffic but don't produce quality videos. So, if you want to increase your revenue from your YouTube videos, try to focus on high-quality content.

### Your monetization method

Several monetization methods exist, including Subscription, advertising, affiliate marketing, paid search, and sponsorships. Each monetization method requires a slightly different setup and management, resulting in different revenue.

### The country you are in

It is important to know that in some countries, making money off YouTube is extremely difficult. For example, in certain countries, monetizing your videos is impossible without using illegal methods, which will get you into legal trouble.
