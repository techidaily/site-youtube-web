#### \- Actively Engage with Your Followers

Because YouTube's algorithm heavily bases its rankings on clicks and comments, you need to engage with your audience and open the doors for more people to watch your video. Interaction with your audience also builds a strong following. You can nurture a community by responding to comments, particularly if one of the viewers asks a direct question. Other viewers will most likely comment on your videos when they are sure you will respond.

#### \- Use Other Social Channels to Get More Views

Let the followers on your other social channels know every time you upload new video on your YouTube channel. You use a short teaser video to do this. People will see the teaser video and click the link you have provided to watch the video. You can also embed the videos in relevant blogs and web pages on your site.

#### \- Optimize the Titles of Your Videos

Because YouTube is a search engine, SEO is crucial if you want people to find your videos and increase your views. As such, you need to conduct keyword research and include the primary keyword in your titles and video descriptions.

This upbeat disco-pop track has soul and funk elements inspired by the Seventies and Eighties. And this theme echoes in the vintage-inspired outfits the members are wearing and the nostalgic settings in the music video.

In the background, viewers will see a warmly-lit record store and poster-studded bedroom that has tributes to The Beatles and David Bowie. The choreography includes shoutouts to Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley and easy-to-follow freestyle dance moves that correspond well with the music.
