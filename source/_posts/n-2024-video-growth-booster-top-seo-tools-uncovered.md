## Bonus Tips: Factors to Consider for YouTube SEO

#### Use descriptive Title Tags (Description)

Be sure to use descriptive title tags; this helps YouTube determine what your video is about, and it increases the likelihood of it appearing in search results for related searches.

#### Place Keywords in Your Video Tags, Description, and Titles

It is imperative to include keywords in your video titles, descriptions, and tags. Essentially, this allows YouTube to know what the content of your videos is about so it can recommend them to an audience interested in similar topics or related searches.

#### Share Your Videos on Social Media

Once you have created great content, you need to share the videos with family and friends to enjoy them! By sharing these videos on social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, you can help to increase their visibility.

#### Optimize Your Channel

After setting up an account on YouTube, you must optimize the rest of your profile; this includes adding a custom avatar picture, bio description, relevant links to other social media sites like Instagram or Twitter, and links to relevant external sites.

#### Use Filmora to Make High-quality YouTube Videos

One of the most effective ways to keep people glued to your channel is by giving them high-quality videos. Filmora can help you edit YouTube videos before publishing them on your YouTube channel.
